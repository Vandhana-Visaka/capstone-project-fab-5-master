9780679783270,Pride and Prejudice,Â«Ãˆ cosa ormai risaputa che a uno scapolo in possesso di un'ingente fortuna manchi soltanto una moglie. Questa veritÃ  Ã¨ cosÃ­ radicata nella mente delle famiglie del luoho che; nel momento in cui un simile personaggio viene a far parte del vicinato; prima ancora di conoscere anche lontanamente i suoi desiderÃ® in proposito; viene immediatamente considerato come proprietÃ  legittima di una o l'altra delle loro figlie.Â»Orgoglio e pregiudizio Ã¨ uno dei primi romanzi di Jane Austen. La scrittrice lo iniziÃ² a ventun anni; il libro; rifiutato da un editore londinese; rimase in un cassetto fino alla sua pubblicazione anonima nel 1813; e da allora Ã¨ considerato tra i piÃº importanti romanzi della letteratura inglese. Ãˆ la storia delle cinque sorelle Bennet e dei loro corteggiatori; con al centro il romantico contrasto tra l'adorabile e capricciosa Elizabeth e l'altezzoso Darcy; lo spirito di osservazione implacabile e quasi cinico; lo studio arguto dei caratteri; la satira delle vanitÃ  e delle debolezze della vita domestica; fanno di questo romanzo una delle piÃº efficaci e indimenticabili commedie di costume del periodo Regency inglese.,English,USA,279,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320399351l/1885.jpg,Crossley,2010-05-05,Jane Austen|Anna Quindlen|Mrs. Oliphant|George Saintsbury|Mark Twain|A.C.

9780743477120,Romeo and Juliet,In Romeo and Juliet; Shakespeare creates a world of violence and generational conflict in which two young people fall in love and die because of that love. The story is rather extraordinary in that the normal problems faced by young lovers are here so very large. It is not simply that the families of Romeo and Juliet disapprove of the lover's affection for each other; rather; the Montagues and the Capulets are on opposite sides in a blood feud and are trying to kill each other on the streets of Verona. Every time a member of one of the two families dies in the fight; his relatives demand the blood of his killer. Because of the feud; if Romeo is discovered with Juliet by her family; he will be killed. Once Romeo is banished; the only way that Juliet can avoid being married to someone else is to take a potion that apparently kills her; so that she is burried with the bodies of her slain relatives. In this violent; death-filled world; the movement of the story from love at first sight to the union of the lovers in death seems almost inevitable.What is so striking about this play is that despite its extraordinary setting (one perhaps reflecting Elizabethan attitudes about hot-blooded Italians); it has become the quintessential story of young love. Because most young lovers feel that they have to overcome giant obstacles in order to be together; because they feel that they would rather die than be kept apart; and especially because the language Shakespeare gives his young lovers is so exquisite; allowing them to say to each other just what we would all say to a lover if we only knew how; it is easy to respond to this play as if it were about all young lovers rather than about a particular couple in a very unusual world. (When the play was rewritten in the eighteen century as The History and Fall of Caius Marius; the violent setting became that of a particularly discordant period in classical Rome; when Leonard Berstein rewrote the play as West Side Story; he chose the violent world of New York street gangs.),English,USA,283,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327872146l/18135.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,William Shakespeare|Barbara A.

She may have a degree; but it is 1962; Mississippi; and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger.

Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son; who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after; though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny; Aibileenâ€™s best friend; is short; fat; and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobodyâ€™s business; but she canâ€™t mind her tongue; so sheâ€™s lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be; these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices; Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town; and the way women â€mothers; daughters; caregivers; friends â€view one another.

9780965818670,The Time Traveler's Wife,A funny; often poignant tale of boy meets girl with a twist: what if one of them couldn't stop slipping in and out of time? Highly original and imaginative; this debut novel raises questions about life; love; and the effects of time on relationships.Audrey Niffeneggerâ€™s innovative debut; The Time Travelerâ€™s Wife; is the story of Clare; a beautiful art student; and Henry; an adventuresome librarian; who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six; and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true; because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time; pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life; past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous; his experiences unpredictable; alternately harrowing and amusing.

She travels to his home; Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire; a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives; she is a rude; stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However; her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home; Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked.

9780316769170,The Catcher in the Rye,The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen; a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult; secondhand description; he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but; almost; hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices; adult voices; underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular; yet remaining marvelously faithful to it; he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However; like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders; he keeps most of the pain to; and for; himself. The pleasure he gives away; or sets aside; with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951.

No one quite knows the reason.""Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest; scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years; the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain; looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His ""wonderful; awful"" idea is to don a Santa outfit; strap heavy antlers on his poor; quivering dog Max; construct a makeshift sleigh; head down to Whoville; and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up; the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents; their food; even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing; but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant; twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos; the transcendent nature of joy; and of course; the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small.

9780143038410,Eat; Pray; Love,A celebrated writer's irresistible; candid; and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure; spiritual devotion; and what she really wanted out of life. Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty; she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated; ambitious American woman was supposed to wantâ€”a husband; a house; a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled; she was consumed with panic; grief; and confusion. She went through a divorce; a crushing depression; another failed love; and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this; Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted; she got rid of her belongings; quit her job; and undertook a yearlong journey around the worldâ€”all alone. Eat; Pray; Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome; she studied the art of pleasure; learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion; and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas; she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali; she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best wayâ€”unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery; Eat; Pray; Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of societyâ€™s ideals.

The character lives beyond her means in order to escape the banalities and emptiness of provincial life.When the novel was first serialized in La Revue de Paris between 1 October 1856 and 15 December 1856; public prosecutors attacked the novel for obscenity.

9780140424390,The Canterbury Tales,The procession that crosses Chaucer's pages is as full of life and as richly textured as a medieval tapestry. The Knight; the Miller; the Friar; the Squire; the Prioress; the Wife of Bath; and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people; with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe; the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of The Canterbury Tales.If we trust the General Prologue; Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works; The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.,English,USA,504,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1261208589l/2696.jpg,Harper Collins,2002-01-02,Geoffrey Chaucer|Nevill Coghill,Classics|Fiction|Poetry|Literature

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle; the nevel creates scenes and characters that have firetd the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist; a master of both action and atmosphere; the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery; greed; and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons; Treasure Island is; in the words of G. K. Chesterton; 'the realization of an ideal; that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like Treasure Island that can keep boys and old men happy.'",English,USA,311,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1485248909l/295.jpg,Random House,2010-05-05,Robert Louis Stevenson,Classics|Fiction|Adventure|Young Adult

The green earflaps; full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves; stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full; pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and; at their corners; sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.""Meet Ignatius J. Reilly; the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale; A Confederacy of Dunces. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans; pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed; and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. (""Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss."") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another; and before he knows it; Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job.Over the next several hundred pages; our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful; and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie; whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly; comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee; proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff; the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through A Confederacy of Dunces are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel; and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish; domineering; and deluded; tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster; revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind; a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life.",English,USA,416,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436747103l/310612.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,John Kennedy Toole|Walker Percy,Fiction|Classics|Humor|Literature

Based on historical people and real events; Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem; rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch; self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953; The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's ""witch-hunts"" in the United States. Within the text itself; Miller contemplates the parallels; writing; ""Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay; which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior.

They were young and in love; with a perfect little house and not a care in the world. Then they brought home Marley; a wiggly yellow furball of a puppy. Life would never be the same.Marley quickly grew into a barreling; ninety-seven-pound streamroller of a Labrador retriever; a dog like no other. He crashed through screen doors; gouged through drywall; flung drool on guests; stole women's undergarments; and ate nearly everything he could get his mouth around; including couches and fine jewelry. Obedience school did no goodâ€”Marley was expelled. Neither did the tranquilizers the veterinarian prescribed for him with the admonishment; ""Don't hesitate to use these.""And yet Marley's heart was pure. Just as he joyfully refused any limits on his behavior; his love and loyalty were boundless; too. Marley shared the couple's joy at their first pregnancy; and their heartbreak over the miscarriage. He was there when babies finally arrived and when the screams of a seventeen-year-old stabbing victim pierced the night. Marley shut down a public beach and managed to land a role in a feature-length movie; always winning hearts as he made a mess of things. Through it all; he remained steadfast; a model of devotion; even when his family was at its wit's end.

ACE #1
At birth; Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda; who bestows on her the ""gift"" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do; Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction; but not feisty Ella: ""Instead of making me docile; Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."" When her beloved mother dies; leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father; and later; a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters; Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse; fending off ogres; befriending elves; and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes; there is a pumpkin coach; a glass slipper; and a happily ever after; but this is the most remarkable; delightful; and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will; and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact; it is she who ultimately rescues him. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards; including a Newbery Honor.",English,USA,232,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1410727190l/24337.jpg,Macmillan,2010-05-05,Gail Carson Levine,Fantasy|Young Adult|Fiction|Romance|Fantasy|Fairy Tales|Childrens

9780743477550,Othello,In Othello; Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona); with elopement; and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean; moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroineâ€”differences of race; of age; of cultural backgroundâ€”that one should not; perhaps; be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer; Iago; who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful; fascinationâ€”which dominates the early acts of the playâ€”turns to horror; especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona; who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults; the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.,English,USA,314,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1459795105l/12996.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,William Shakespeare,Classics|Plays|Drama|Fiction|Academic|School

9780743298020,The Thirteenth Tale,All children mythologize their birth...So begins the prologue of reclusive author Vida Winter's collection of stories; which are as famous for the mystery of the missing thirteenth tale as they are for the delight and enchantment of the twelve that do exist. The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself -- all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing; she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea; a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth; hidden by those who loved her most; remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own; Margaret takes on the commission. As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good; Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family; including the beautiful and willful Isabelle; the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline; a ghost; a governess; a topiary garden and a devastating fire. Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida; and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming; finally; transformed by the truth themselves. The Thirteenth Tale is a love letter to reading; a book for the feral reader in all of us; a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children.

Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work ""quite uninhibited and beautifully written; which anticipates D. H. Lawrence in its treatment of infidelity.""

9780767908180,A Short History of Nearly Everything,In Bryson's biggest book; he confronts his greatest challenge: to understandâ€”and; if possible; answerâ€”the oldest; biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization; Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end; he has attached himself to a host of the worldâ€™s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists; anthropologists; and mathematicians; travelling to their offices; laboratories; and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books; pestered them with questions; apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest; and it is a sometimes profound; sometimes funny; and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge; as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.,English,UK,544,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1433086293l/21.jpg,Hachette,1970-02-01,Bill Bryson,Nonfiction|Science|History
9781400078780,Never Let Me Go,From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Remains of the Day and When We Were Orphans; comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human.Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school; far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported; trained in art and literature; and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But; curiously; they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.Within the grounds of Hailsham; Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman; but itâ€™s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery; a beautiful love story; and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past; Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.,English,USA,288,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353048590l/6334.jpg,Macmillan,1988-01-01,Kazuo Ishiguro,Fiction|Science Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia

9780679751530,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"A sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written; this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty; early morning hours of May 2; 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade; the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed; suspenseful; and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel; and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man; woman; and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the ""soul of pampered self-absorption""; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking; piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva; the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight.

9780679720220,The Plague,A gripping tale of human unrelieved horror; of survival and resilience; and of the ways in which humankind confronts death; The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel; eloquently understated and epic in scope; and a parable of ageless moral resonance; profoundly relevant to our times.

In nineteen minutes; you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five....In nineteen minutes; you can stop the world; or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes; you can get revenge. Sterling is a small; ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens -- until the day its complacency is shattered by a shocking act of violence. In the aftermath; the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them; the lines between truth and fiction; right and wrong; insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier; the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case; could be the state's best witness; but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes.

9780765356150,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,Sophisticated; witty; and ingeniously convincing; Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England. She has created a world so thoroughly enchanting that eight hundred pages leave readers longing for more.English magicians were once the wonder of the known world; with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds; mountains; and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long; dull papers about it; while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire; the rich; reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte; creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome; charming; and talkative-the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician; Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell; their power is something to be cautiously controlled; while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest; most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient; shadowy figure of the Raven King; a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie; and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell; but everything that he holds dear.,English,UK,1006,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1357027589l/14201.jpg,Random House,2010-05-05,Susanna Clarke,Fantasy|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Historical|Fantasy|Magic

9780142000660,East of Eden,In his journal; Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden â€œthe first book;â€and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of Californiaâ€™s Salinas Valley; this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two familiesâ€”the Trasks and the Hamiltonsâ€”whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins; Cal and Aaron; brings his wife to the brink of madness; and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952; East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity; the enecplicability of love; and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years; East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.--jacket flap,English,USA,601,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441547516l/4406.jpg,Macmillan,1988-01-01,John Steinbeck,Classics|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Literature

The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham; the fair's brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country's most important structures; including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington; D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes; a young doctor who; in a malign parody of the White City; built his ""World's Fair Hotel"" just west of the fairgroundsâ€”a torture palace complete with dissection table; gas chamber; and 3;000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted; Charles McKim; Louis Sullivan; and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City; while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived; walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.The Devil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty; made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters; including Buffalo Bill; Theodore Dreiser; Susan B.

The text of this new edition is as it appeared in the original uncensored edition of 1905. It contains the full 36 chapters as originally published; rather than the 31 of the expurgated edition.

9780143037610,Bleak House,Bleak House is a novel by Charles Dickens; published in 20 monthly installments between March 1852 and September 1853. It is held to be one of Dickens's finest novels; containing one of the most vast; complex and engaging arrays of minor characters and sub-plots in his entire canon.At the novel's core is long-running litigation in England's Court of Chancery; Jarndyce v Jarndyce; which has far-reaching consequences for all involved. The litigation; which already has taken many years and consumed between Â£60;000 and Â£70;000 in court costs; is emblematic of the failure of Chancery.Though Chancery lawyers and judges criticised Dickens's portrait of Chancery as exaggerated and unmerited; his novel helped to spur an ongoing movement that culminated in the enactment of legal reform in the 1870s.,English,UK,1017,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1280113147l/31242.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Charles Dickens|Nicola Bradbury|Hablot Knight Browne,Classics|Fiction|Literature|Literature|19th Century

9780307346600,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,"The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks; driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years; traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world; from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men; women; and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living; or at least the undead; hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror; and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance; that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China; where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero; to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold; to the United States of Southern Africa; where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price; to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn; this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all; the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader; but the effort is invaluable because; as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction; ""By excluding the human factor; aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may; heaven forbid; lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end; isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.",English,USA,342,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1528312647l/8908.jpg,Crossley,2012-08-09,Max Brooks,Horror|Fiction|Horror|Zombies|Science Fiction|Fantasy|Apocalyptic|Post Apocalyptic

9780743223130,John Adams,The enthralling; often surprising story of John Adams; one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.In this powerful; epic biography; David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams; the brilliant; fiercely independent; often irascible; always honest Yankee patriot -- the colossus of independence; as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as out of his senses; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. Like his masterly; Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman; David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time; much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular; the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams; nearly half of which have never been published; provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. As he has with stunning effect in his previous books; McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who; caught up in events; had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington; Benjamin Franklin; John Jay; the British spy Edward Bancroft; Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris interest Maria Cosway; Alexander Hamilton; James Madison; the scandalmonger James Callender; Sally Hemings; John Marshall; Talleyrand; and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle; as does; importantly; John Quincy Adams; the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. Crucial to the story; as it was to history; is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson; born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son; the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder; one short and stout; the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson; very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries; then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties; they became archrivals; even enemies; in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800; perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then; amazingly; they became friends again; and ultimately; incredibly; they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4; in the year 1826. Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI; from Spain to Amsterdam; from the Court of St. James's; where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation; to the raw; half-finished Capital by the Potomac; where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues; but also about human nature; love; religious faith; virtue; ambition; friendship and betrayal; and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all; John Adams is an enthralling; often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.,English,UK,751 ,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1478144278l/2203.jpg,Penguin,2010-05-05,David McCullough,History|Biography|Nonfiction|North American Hi...|American History|Politics|Presidents

The title of the book refers to an actual pendulum designed by the French physicist LÃ©on Foucault to demonstrate the rotation of the earth; which has symbolic significance within the novel.Bored with their work; and after reading too many manuscripts about occult conspiracy theories; three vanity publisher employees (Belbo; Diotallevi and Casaubon) invent their own conspiracy for fun. They call this satirical intellectual game The Plan; a hoax that connects the medieval Knights Templar with other occult groups from ancient to modern times. This produces a map indicating the geographical point from which all the powers of the earth can be controlledâ€”a point located in Paris; France; at Foucaultâ€™s Pendulum. But in a fateful turn the joke becomes all too real.The three become increasingly obsessed with The Plan; and sometimes forget that it's just a game. Worse still; other conspiracy theorists learn about The Plan; and take it seriously.

9781860498800,The Blind Assassin,Margaret Atwood takes the art of storytelling to new heights in a dazzling novel that unfolds layer by astonishing layer and concludes in a brilliant and wonderfully satisfying twist. Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and clichÃ©s of the 1930s and 1940s; The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.It opens with these simple; resonant words: Ten days after the war ended; my sister drove a car off the bridge. They are spoken by Iris; whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental.

9780375725780,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,'When you read his extraordinary memoir you don't laugh; then cry; then laugh again; you somehow experience these emotions all at once.'Well; this was when Bill was sighing a lot. He had decided that after our parents died he just didn't want any more fighting between what was left of us. He was twenty-four; Beth was twenty-three; I was twenty-one; Toph was eight; and all of us were so tried already; from that winter. So when something would come up; any little thing; some bill to pay or decision to make; he would just sigh; his eyes tired; his mouth in a sorry kind of smile. But Beth and I...Jesus; we were fighting with everyone; anyone; each other; with strangers at bars; anywhere -- we were angry people wanting to exact revenge. We came to California and we wanted everything; would take what was ours; anything within reach. And I decided that little Toph and I; he with his backward hat and long hair; living together in our little house in Berkeley; would be world-destroyers. We inherited each other and; we felt; a responsibility to reinvent everything; to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows. It was a hopeless sort of exhilaration; a kind of arrogance born of fatalism; I guess; of the feeling that if you could lose a couple of parents in a month; then basically anything could happen; at any time -- all bullets bear your name; all cars are there to crush you; any balcony could give way; more disaster seemed only logical. And then; as in Dorothy's dream; all these people I grew up with were there; too; some of them orphans also; most but not all of us believing that what we had been given was extraordinary; that it was time to tear or break down; ruin; remake; take and devour. This was San Francisco; you know; and everyone had some dumb idea -- I mean; wicca? -- and no one there would tell you yours was doomed. Thus the public nudity; and this ridiculous magazine; and the Real World tryout; all this need; most of it disguised by sneering; but all driven by a hyper-awareness of this window; I guess; a few years when your muscles are taut; coiled up and vibrating. But what to do with the energy? I mean; when we drive; Toph and I; and we drive past people; standing on top of all these hills; part of me wants to stop the car and turn up the radio and have us all dance in formation; and part of me wants to run them all over."",English,UK,485 ,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327714834l/4953.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Dave Eggers,Fiction

9780679763970,Corelli's Mandolin,Captain Corelliâ€™s Mandolin is set in the early days of the second world war; before Benito Mussolini invaded Greece. Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia; accompanied by his daughter; Pelagia; to whom he imparts much of his healing art. Even when the Italians do invade; life isnâ€™t so badâ€”at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli; who responds to a Nazi greeting of â€œHeil Hitlerâ€with his own â€œHeil Pucciniâ€ and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman; Mandras; who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime; even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia; it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances; both personal and political; as all around them atrocities mount; former friends become enemies and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches. British author Louis de BerniÃ¨res is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts; SeÃ±or Vivo and the Coca Lord and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman. Here he keeps it to a minimum; though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his islandâ€”the drunken priest; the strongman; the fisherman who swims with dolphinsâ€”would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead; de BerniÃ¨res seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. Captain Corelliâ€™s Mandolin works on many levels; as a love story; a war story and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books.,English,UK,437 ,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1479680795l/3388.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2010-05-05,Louis de-BerniÃ¨res,Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Romance|Classics|War|Historical

That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book; including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE); which probed back in time to within 300;000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations; as well as his own recent research; Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book; written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel; and updated the chapters throughout.,English,UK,212 ,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333578746l/3869.jpg,Penguin,1988-01-01,Stephen Hawking,Science|Nonfiction|Science|Physics|History
9780088619450,If on a Winter's Night a Traveler,If on a Winter's Night a Traveler is a marvel of ingenuity; an experimental text that looks longingly back to the great age of narrationâ€when time no longer seemed stopped and did not yet seem to have exploded."" Italo Calvino's novel is in one sense a comedy in which the two protagonists; the Reader and the Other Reader; ultimately end up married; having almost finished If on a Winter's Night a Traveler. In another; it is a tragedy; a reflection on the difficulties of writing and the solitary nature of reading. The Reader buys a fashionable new book; which opens with an exhortation: ""Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade."" Alas; after 30 or so pages; he discovers that his copy is corrupted; and consists of nothing but the first section; over and over. Returning to the bookshop; he discovers the volume; which he thought was by Calvino; is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two; he goes for the Pole; as does the Other Reader; Ludmilla.

9780967686560,The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ,"The Book of Mormon is a volume of scripture comparable to the Bible. It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains; as does the Bible; the fullness of the everlasting gospel.The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words; written on gold plates; were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C.; and afterward separated into two nations; known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years; all were destroyed except the Lamanites; and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians. The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel; outlines the plan of salvation; and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come. After Mormon completed his writings; he delivered the account to his son Moroni; who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21; 1823; the same Moroni; then a glorified; resurrected being; appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language. In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith; who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved. Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: ""I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth; and the keystone of our religion; and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts; than by any other book."" In addition to Joseph Smith; the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included herewith as ""The Testimony of Three Witnesses"" and ""The Testimony of Eight Witnesses.""",English,UK,531,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327389004l/323355.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,Anonymous|Joseph Smith Jr.,Religion|Nonfiction|Christianity|Lds|Religion|Church

9780679729520,The Aeneid,The Aeneid is an epic poem written by Virgil in the 1st century BC. It's hero is Aeneas; a Trojan who travels from Troy to Italy to eventually found Rome. Some argue that The Aeneid is Virgil's answer to Homer's Odyssey and Iliad; combining two genres of the day - travel and war - into one poem. Take that; Homer!No civilization is without a bit of revisionist history: so it was that Virgil picked up the story of Aeneas; which was already floating around at the time; and forged an epic founding myth for Rome. And The Aeneid fit the bill; as it linked Rome with the legends of ancient Troy; glorified stodgy Roman values; and legitimized its emperors as descendants of the heroes and gods of the past.

9780061234000,Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics; #1),Which is more dangerous; a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple; unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight; Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is; at root; the study of incentives -- how people get what they want; or need; especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics; they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well; everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world; despite a surfeit of obfuscation; complication; and downright deceit; is not impenetrable; is not unknowable; and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt; through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking; shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work; then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.,English,UK,320,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327909092l/1202.jpg,Random House,2002-01-02,Steven D. Levitt|Stephen J.

9781841156740,The Corrections,"Winner of the National Book Award for FictionNominated for the National Book Critics Circle AwardAn American Library Association Notable BookJonathan Franzen's third novel; The Corrections; is a great work of art and a grandly entertaining overture to our new century: a bold; comic; tragic; deeply moving family drama that stretches from the Midwest at mid-century to Wall Street and Eastern Europe in the age of greed and globalism. Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty; of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions; into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science; home surveillance; hands-off parenting; do-it-yourself mental healthcare; and the anti-gravity New Economy. With The Corrections; Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul.Enid Lambert is terribly; terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children; her husband; Alfred; is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease; or maybe it's his negative attitude; but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy; unspeakable acts. More and more often; he doesn't seem to understand a word Enid says.Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid's children. Her older son; Gary; a banker in Philadelphia; has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child; Chip; has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City; where he seems to be pursuing a ""transgressive"" lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay. Meanwhile the baby of the family; Denise; has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints.Enid; who loves to have fun; can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on. But even these few remaining joys are threatened by her husband's growing confusion and unsteadiness. As Alfred enters his final decline; the Lamberts must face the failures; secrets; and long-buried hurts that haunt them as a family if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs.",English,UK,653,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355011305l/3805.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1970-02-01,Jonathan Franzen,Fiction|Contemporary|Novels

9780618485220,The Namesake,Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies established this young writer as one the most brilliant of her generation. Her stories are one of the very few debut works -- and only a handful of collections -- to have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Among the many other awards and honors it received were the New Yorker Debut of the Year award; the PEN/Hemingway Award; and the highest critical praise for its grace; acuity; and compassion in detailing lives transported from India to America.In The Namesake; Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience; the clash of cultures; the conflicts of assimilation; and; most poignantly; the tangled ties between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect detail â€the fleeting moment; the turn of phrase â€that opens whole worlds of emotion.The Namesake takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged wedding; Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge; Massachusetts. An engineer by training; Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife; who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born; the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before; Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd; antic name. Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path; strewn with conflicting loyalties; comic detours; and wrenching love affairs.

9780743269510,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People; the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that; they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people; education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a â€˜successâ€in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Coveyâ€™s model fully well; or maybe there are some people who havenâ€™t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now; I am not saying that by using Coveyâ€™s model; or anyone elseâ€™s model for that matter; you can become a sure-shot success; but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So; where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here; and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or; they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Coveyâ€™s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are; they can rattle them off end to end; but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book; yes; and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Coveyâ€™s book; or rather; his model; was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it; there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But; before we barge into that area; it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first; and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life.,English,USA,372,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1421842784l/36072.jpg,Hachette,1988-01-01,Stephen R.

Set in imperial Russia during the 1820s; Pushkin's novel in verse follows the emotions and destiny of three men - Onegin the bored fop; Lensky the minor elegiast; and a stylized Pushkin himself - and the fates and affections of three women - Tatyana the provincial beauty; her sister Olga; and Pushkin's mercurial Muse. Engaging; full of suspense; and varied in tone; it also portrays a large cast of other characters and offers the reader many literary; philosophical; and autobiographical digressions; often in a highly satirical vein. Eugene Onegin was Pushkin's own favourite work; and it shows him attempting to transform himself from romantic poet into realistic novelist.

Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning; they lived like nomads; moving among Southwest desert towns; camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic; brilliant man who; when sober; captured his children's imagination; teaching them physics; geology; and above all; how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary; who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family; called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. Later; when the money ran out; or the romance of the wandering life faded; the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated; Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves; supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and; finally; found the resources and will to leave home. What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out; but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds; but also a tender; moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.

A self-declared ""light-skinned"" woman evasive about her ethnicity; yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride; journalist; musician and son; explores his mother's past; as well as his own upbringing and heritage; in a poignant and powerful debut; The Color Of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother. The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white; James McBride grew up in ""orchestrated chaos"" with his eleven siblings in the poor; all-black projects of Red Hook; Brooklyn. ""Mommy;"" a fiercely protective woman with ""dark eyes full of pep and fire;"" herded her brood to Manhattan's free cultural events; sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools; demanded good grades and commanded respect. As a young man; McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment; worry; and confusion--and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain. In The Color of Water; McBride retraces his mother's footsteps and; through her searing and spirited voice; recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi; she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1; 1921. Fleeing pogroms; her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk; Virginia; a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high.

9781400052170,The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,"
Intimate in feeling; astonishing in scope; and impossible to put down; The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery; as well as its human consequences.
Her name was Henrietta Lacks; but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors; yet her cellsâ€”taken without her knowledgeâ€”became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first â€œimmortalâ€human cells grown in culture; they are still alive today; though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale; theyâ€™d weigh more than 50 million metric tonsâ€”as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer; viruses; and the atom bombâ€™s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization; cloning; and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown; buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey; from the â€œcoloredâ€ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henriettaâ€™s small; dying hometown of Clover; Virginia â€a land of wooden slave quarters; faith healings; and voodoo â€to East Baltimore today; where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henriettaâ€™s family did not learn of her â€œimmortalityâ€until more than twenty years after her death; when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials; her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows; the story of the Lacks family â€past and present â€is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans; the birth of bioethics; and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story; Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks familyâ€”especially Henriettaâ€™s daughter Deborah; who was devastated to learn about her motherâ€™s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister; Elsie; who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine; why couldnâ€™t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling; astonishing in scope; and impossible to put down; The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery; as well as its human consequences.",English,USA,370,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327878144l/6493208.jpg,Crossley,2012-08-09,Rebecca Skloot,Nonfiction|Science|Biography|History|Health|Medicine
9780140047490,Thus Spoke Zarathustra,Friedrich Nietzsche's most accessible and influential philosophical work; misquoted; misrepresented; brilliantly original and enormously influential; Thus Spoke Zarathustra is translated from the German by R.J. Hollingdale in Penguin Classics.Nietzsche was one of the most revolutionary and subversive thinkers in Western philosophy; and Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains his most famous and influential work. It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman; the human embodiment of divinity; is his successor. Nietzsche's utterance 'God is dead'; his insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms; and his doctrine of the Superman and the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by; among others; Nazi intellectuals. With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance; Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority; but in an all-powerful life force: passionate; chaotic and free.Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker; Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers; such as George Bernard Shaw; D.H. Lawrence; Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre; was considerable.If you enjoyed Thus Spoke Zarathustra you might like Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil; also available in Penguin Classics.

9780199291150,The Selfish Gene,"The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Editionâ€”with a new Introduction by the AuthorInheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin; Watson; and Crick; Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of The Selfish Gene. Suppose; instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves; as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered; we turn it around and imagine that ""our"" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years; and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since.Why are there miles and miles of ""unused"" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity; Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology; he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas; or memes; which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets; he says; at least we can try to understand our strings. â€”Rob Lightner",English,USA,360,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366758096l/61535.jpg,Random House,1970-02-01,Richard Dawkins,Science|Nonfiction|Science|Biology|Biology|Evolution|Philosophy

Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights; by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier; Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in lifeâ€”having nothing but his own wits to help him along. Born in the dark heart of India; Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man; two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles); and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car; Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (""Love -- Rape -- Revenge!""); barter for girls; drink liquor (Thunderbolt); and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society; Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks; barter for girls; drink liquor (single-malt whiskey); and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas; deal with corrupt mechanics; and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive. Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and; trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible; the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected; Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue; and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world; and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations. The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition; scope; and narrative genius; with a mischief and personality all its own.

As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence; the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.,English,UK,457,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405201597l/17349.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2002-01-02,Carl Sagan|Ann Druyan,Science|Nonfiction|Philosophy|Religion|Philosophy|Skepticism

9780060838580,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,A groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.Are we what we eat? To a degree both engrossing and alarming; the story of fast food is the story of postwar America. Though created by a handful of mavericks; the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape; widened the chasm between rich and poor; fueled an epidemic of obesity; and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad. That's a lengthy list of charges; but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage; wry wit; and careful reasoning. Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast food's flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold America's most dangerous job -- meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers' convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations. Along the way; Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating; unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production; popular culture; and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains' efforts to reel in the youngest; most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization -- a phenomenon launched by fast food. Fast Food Nation is a groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.,English,USA,399,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388181135l/1097.jpg,Crossley,2010-05-05,Eric Schlosser,Nonfiction|Food and Drink|Food|Health|Sociology|Politics

9780007127740,The Illustrated Man,"That The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival; later reworked into The October Country); it is a marvelous; if mostly dark; quilt of science fiction; fantasy; and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book; Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable; and increasingly disturbing; is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive; and each proceeds to unfold its own story; such as ""The Veldt;"" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or ""Kaleidoscope;"" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or ""Zero Hour;"" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s; these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. --Stanley WiaterContents:Â· Prologue: The Illustrated Man Â· ss * Â· The Veldt [â€œThe World the Children Madeâ€] Â· ss The Saturday Evening Post Sep 23 â€0 Â· Kaleidoscope Â· ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Oct â€9 Â· The Other Foot Â· ss New Story Magazine Mar â€1 Â· The Highway [as by Leonard Spalding] Â· ss Copy Spr â€0 Â· The Man Â· ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Feb â€9 Â· The Long Rain [â€œDeath-by-Rainâ€] Â· ss Planet Stories Sum â€0 Â· The Rocket Man Â· ss Macleanâ€™s Mar 1 â€1 Â· The Fire Balloons [â€œâ€˜In This Sign...â€™â€] Â· ss Imagination Apr â€1 Â· The Last Night of the World Â· ss Esquire Feb â€1 Â· The Exiles [â€œThe Mad Wizards of Marsâ€] Â· ss Macleanâ€™s Sep 15 â€9; F&SF Win â€0 Â· No Particular Night or Morning Â· ss * Â· The Fox and the Forest [â€œTo the Futureâ€] Â· ss Colliers May 13 â€0 Â· The Visitor Â· ss Startling Stories Nov â€8 Â· The Concrete Mixer Â· ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Apr â€9 Â· Marionettes; Inc.

It is to introvertsâ€”Rosa Parks; Chopin; Dr. Seuss; Steve Wozniakâ€”that we owe many of the great contributions to society.In Quiet; Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so.

9780451529700,Fathers and Sons,Bazarovâ€”a gifted; impatient; and caustic young manâ€”has journeyed from school to the home of his friend Arkady Kirsanov. But soon Bazarovâ€™s outspoken rejection of authority and social conventions touches off quarrels; misunderstandings; and romantic entanglements that will utterly transform the Kirsanov household and reflect the changes taking place all across nineteenth-century Russia. Fathers and Sons enraged the old and the young; reactionaries; romantics; and radicals alike when it was first published. At the same time; Turgenev won the acclaim of Flaubert; Maupassant; and Henry James for his craftsmanship as a writer and his psychological insight. Fathers and Sons is now considered one of the worldâ€™s greatest novels. A timeless depiction of generational conflict during social upheaval; it vividly portrays the clash between the older Russian aristocracy and the youthful radicalism that foreshadowed the revolution to comeâ€”and offers modern-day readers much to reflect upon as they look around at their own tumultuous; ever changing world.

9780553265960,Darkness at Noon,"Darkness at Noon (from the German: Sonnenfinsternis) is a novel by the Hungarian-born British novelist Arthur Koestler; first published in 1940. His best-known work tells the tale of Rubashov; a Bolshevik 1917 revolutionary who is cast out; imprisoned and tried for treason by the Soviet government he'd helped create.Darkness at Noon stands as an unequaled fictional portrayal of the nightmare politics of our time. Its hero is an aging revolutionary; imprisoned and psychologically tortured by the Party to which he has dedicated his life. As the pressure to confess preposterous crimes increases; he relives a career that embodies the terrible ironies and human betrayals of a totalitarian movement masking itself as an instrument of deliverance. Almost unbearably vivid in its depiction of one man's solitary agony; it asks questions about ends and means that have relevance not only for the past but for the perilous present. It is â€ as the Times Literary Supplement has declared â€ ""A remarkable book; a grimly fascinating interpretation of the logic of the Russian Revolution; indeed of all revolutionary dictatorships; and at the same time a tense and subtly intellectualized drama.""",English,USA,216,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1290053535l/30672.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1970-02-01,Arthur Koestler|Daphne Hardy|PÄ±nar KÃ¼r,Fiction|Classics|Historical|Historical Fiction|Politics|Cultural|Russia|Literature|Novels

'I shall never regret doing as I haveâ€”never; if I starve or beg in consequence'
When Nicholas Nickleby is left penniless after his father's death; he appeals to his wealthy uncle to help him find work and to protect his mother and sister. But Ralph Nickleby proves both hard-hearted and unscrupulous; and Nicholas finds himself forced to make his own way in the world. His adventures gave Dickens the opportunity to portray an extraordinary gallery of rogues and eccentrics: Wackford Squeers; the tyrannical headmaster of Dotheboys Hall; a school for unwanted boys; the slow-witted orphan Smike; rescued by Nicholas; and the gloriously theatrical Mr and Mrs Crummles and their daughter; the 'infant phenonenon'. Like many of Dickens's novels; Nicholas Nickleby is characterised by his outrage at cruelty and social injustice; but it is also a flamboyantly exuberant work; revealing his comic genius at its most unerring.Mark Ford's introduction compares Nicholas Nickleby to eighteenth-century picaresque novels; and examines Dickens's criticism of the 'Yorkshire Schools'; his social satire and use of language.

9780307265840,After Dark,A short; sleek novel of encounters set in Tokyo during the witching hours between midnight and dawn; and every bit as gripping as Haruki Murakamiâ€™s masterworks The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Kafka on the Shore.At its center are two sistersâ€”Eri; a fashion model slumbering her way into oblivion; and Mari; a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous Dennyâ€™s toward people whose lives are radically alien to her own: a jazz trombonist who claims theyâ€™ve met before; a burly female â€œlove hotelâ€manager and her maid staff; and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman. These â€œnight peopleâ€are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart; and it soon becomes clear that Eriâ€™s slumberâ€”mysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crimeâ€”will either restore or annihilate her.After Dark moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation; interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agencyâ€”the interplay between self-expression and empathy; between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love. Murakamiâ€™s trademark humor; psychological insight; and grasp of spirit and morality are here distilled with an extraordinary; harmonious mastery.,English,UK,191,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437952316l/17803.jpg,Penguin,1988-01-01,Haruki Murakami|Jay Rubin,Fiction|Cultural|Japan|Asian Literature|Japanese Literature|Magical Realism|Contemporary

Hollingdale with an introduction by Michael Tanner in Penguin Classics.Beyond Good and Evil confirmed Nietzsche's position as the towering European philosopher of his age. The work dramatically rejects the tradition of Western thought with its notions of truth and God; good and evil. Nietzsche demonstrates that the Christian world is steeped in a false piety and infected with a 'slave morality'. With wit and energy; he turns from this critique to a philosophy that celebrates the present and demands that the individual imposes their own 'will to power' upon the world.This edition includes a commentary on the text by the translator and Michael Tanner's introduction; which explains some of the more abstract passages in Beyond Good and Evil.Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker; Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers; such as George Bernard Shaw; D.H. Lawrence; Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre; was considerable.If you enjoyed Beyond Good and Evil you might like Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra; also available in Penguin Classics.""One of the greatest books of a very great thinker."" â€”Michael Tanner",English,USA,240,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388607391l/12321.jpg,Hachette,1970-02-01,Friedrich Nietzsche|R.J.

With astonishing empathy and the effortless grace of a natural storyteller; Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie weaves together the lives of three characters swept up in the turbulence of the decade. Thirteen-year-old Ugwu is employed as a houseboy for a university professor full of revolutionary zeal. Olanna is the professorâ€™s beautiful mistress; who has abandoned her life of privilege in Lagos for a dusty university town and the charisma of her new lover. And Richard is a shy young Englishman in thrall to Olannaâ€™s twin sister; an enigmatic figure who refuses to belong to anyone. As Nigerian troops advance and the three must run for their lives; their ideals are severely tested; as are their loyalties to one another. Epic; ambitious; and triumphantly realized; Half of a Yellow Sun is a remarkable novel about moral responsibility; about the end of colonialism; about ethnic allegiances; about class and raceâ€”and the ways in which love can complicate them all. Adichie brilliantly evokes the promise and the devastating disappointments that marked this time and place; bringing us one of the most powerful; dramatic; and intensely emotional pictures of modern Africa that we have ever had.,English,UK,433,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327934717l/18749.jpg,Random House,2010-05-05,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Cultural|Africa|Western Africa|Nigeria|War|Historical

9780375700810,The Executioner's Song,In what is arguably his greatest book; America's most heroically ambitious writer follows the short; blighted career of Gary Gilmore; an intractably violent product of America's prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first; for robbing two men in 1976; then killing them in cold blood; and; second; after being tried and convicted; for insisting on dying for his crime. To do so; he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority; steely compassion; and a restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down; impossible to forget.Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize,English,USA,1056,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1325755176l/12468.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Norman Mailer,Nonfiction|Crime|True Crime|Mystery|Crime

9789725681370,Os Maias,"Os Maias Ã© uma das obras mais conhecidas do escritor portuguÃªs EÃ§a de Queiroz. O livro foi publicado no Porto em 1888. A acÃ§Ã£o de Os Maias passa-se em Lisboa; na segunda metade do sÃ©culo XIX; e apresenta-nos a histÃ³ria de trÃªs geraÃ§Ãµes da famÃ­lia Maia. A acÃ§Ã£o inicia-se no Outono de 1875; quando Afonso da Maia; nobre e pobre proprietÃ¡rio; se instala no Ramalhete com o neto recÃ©m formado em Medicina. Neste momento faz-se uma longa descriÃ§Ã£o da casa - ""O Ramalhete;"" cujo nome tem origem num painel de azulejos com um ramo de girassÃ³is; e nÃ£o em algo fresco ou campestre; tal como o nome nos remete a pensar. Afonso da Maia era o personagem mais simpÃ¡tico do romance e aquele que o autor mais valorizou; pois nÃ£o se lhe conhecem defeitos. Ã‰ um homem de carÃ¡cter; culto e requintado nos gostos. Em jovem aderiu aos ideais do Liberalismo e foi obrigado; por seu pai; a sair de casa e a instalar-se em Inglaterra. ApÃ³s o pai falecer regressa a Lisboa para casar com Maria Eduarda Runa; mas pouco tempo depois escolhe o exÃ­lio por razÃµes de ordem polÃ­tica. HÃ¡ em Os Maias um retrato da Lisboa da epÃ³ca. Carlos; que mora na Rua das Janelas Verdes; caminha com frequÃªncia atÃ© ao Rossio (embora; por vezes; vÃ¡ a cavalo ou de carruagem). Algumas das lojas citadas no livro ainda existem - a Casa Havaneza; no Chiado; por exemplo. Ã‰ possÃ­vel seguir os diferentes percursos de Carlos ou do Ega pelas suas da Baixa lisboeta; ainda que algumas tenham mudado de nome. No final do livro; quando Carlos volta a Lisboa muitos anos depois; somos levados a ver as novidades - a Avenida da Liberdade; que substituiu o Passeio PÃºblico; e que Ã© descrita como uma coisa nova; e feia pela sua novidade; exactamente como nos anos 70 se falava das casas de emigrante. O romance veicula sobre o paÃ­s uma perspectiva muito derrotista; muito pessimista. Tirando a natureza (o Tejo; Sintra; Santa OlÃ¡via...); Ã© tudo uma choldra ignÃ³bil. Predomina uma visÃ£o de estrangeirado; de quem sÃ³ valoriza as civilizaÃ§Ãµes superiores - da FranÃ§a e Inglaterra; principalmente. Os polÃ­ticos sÃ£o mesquinhos; ignorantes ou corruptos (Gouvarinho; Sousa Neto...); os homens das Letras sao boÃ©mios e dissolutos; retrÃ³grados ou distantes da realidade concreta (Alencar; Ega...: lembre-se o que se passou no Sarau do Teatro da Trindade); os jornalistas boÃ©mios e venais (Palma...); os homens do desporto nÃ£o conseguem organizar uma corrida de cavalos; pois nÃ£o hÃ¡ hipÃ³dromo Ã  altura; nem cavalos; nem cavaleiros; as pessoas nÃ£o vestem como o evento exigia; as senhoras traziam vestidos de missa. Para cÃºmulo de tudo isto; os protagonistas acabam vencidos da vida. Apesar de ser isto referido no fim do livro; pode-se ver que ainda hÃ¡ alguma esperanca implÃ­cita; nas passagens em que Carlos da Maia e JoÃ£o da Ega dizem que o apetite humano Ã© a causa de todos os seus problemas e que portanto nunca mais terÃ£o apetites; mas logo a seguir dizem que lhes estÃ¡ a apetecer um ""prato de paio com ervilhas;"" ou quando dizem que a pressa nÃ£o leva a nada e que a vida deve ser levada com calma mas comeÃ§am a correr para apanhar o americano (elÃ©ctrico). Mais do que crÃ­tica de costumes; o romance mostra-nos um paÃ­s - sobretudo Lisboa - que se dissolve; incapaz de se regenerar. Quando o autor escreve mais tarde A Cidade e as Serras; expÃµe uma atitude muito mais construtiva: o protagonista regenera-se pela descoberta das raÃ­zes rurais ancestrais nÃ£o atingidas pela degradaÃ§Ã£o da civilizaÃ§Ã£o; num movimento inverso ao que predomina n'Os Maias.",English,UK,681,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1362526641l/1249630.jpg,Hachette,1970-02-01,EÃ§a de QueirÃ³s|Ester de Lemos,Classics|European Literature|Portuguese Literature|Fiction|Romance|Cultural|Portugal

They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books; and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. In The Hour I First Believed; Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth; psychology; family history stretching back many generations; and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force; at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife; Maureen; a school nurse; move to Littleton; Colorado; they both get jobs at Columbine High School.

But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right; and further tragedy ensues. While Maureen fights to regain her sanity; Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries; letters; and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house.

His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary -- and American.The Hour I First Believed is a profound and heart-rending work of fiction.

9780141182350,The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories,This collection spans Lovecraftâ€™s literary career; and charts the development of his â€˜cosmicistâ€philosophy; the belief that behind the veil of our blinkered everyday lives lies another reality; too terrible for the human mind to comprehend. In stories written in the gothic tradition; narrators recount their descent into madness and despair. Through their investigations into the unexplained; they tug at the thin threads that separate our world from another of indescribable horror. â€˜â€Great God! I never dreamed of THIS!â€â€screams occultist Harley Warren in â€˜The Statement of Randolph Carterâ€ as he begs his companion to bury him alive. Another early piece; â€˜The Outsiderâ€â€a tragic and emotive evocation of loneliness and desolation â€follows a manâ€™s escape from his castle in a desperate search for human contact; but the loathsome truth he discovers destroys his mind.In later tales; such as the iconic â€˜The Call of Cthulhuâ€and â€˜The Whisperer in Darknessâ€ Lovecraft reaches into the cosmos; bridging the divide between horror and science fiction. The extra-terrestrial â€˜godsâ€and cursed histories that would emerge from these stories now form the cornerstones of Lovecraftâ€™s unique mythology: the Cthulhu Mythos. This fictional universe; built in large part by his friend and most ardent supporter August Derleth; has in the years since been reimagined in myriad forms; and continues to act as a haunted playground for countless illustrators; fans and authors.This edition; based on its sister limited edition; marries Lovecraftâ€™s best-known fiction with two modern masters of the macabre; the acclaimed artist Dan Hillier and author Alan Moore. In his beautifully crafted new preface; Moore finds Lovecraft at once at odds with and integral to the time in which he lived: â€˜the improbable embodiment of an estranged world in transitionâ€ Yet; despite his prejudices and parochialisms; he â€˜possessed a voice and a perspective both unique in modern literatureâ€Hillierâ€™s six mesmerising; portal-like illustrations embrace the alien realities that lurk among the gambrel roofs of Lovecraftâ€™s landscapes. By splicing Victorian portraits and lithographs with cosmic and Lovecraftian symbolism; each piece â€like the stories themselves â€pulls apart the familiar to reveal what lies beneath.The edition itself shimmers with Lovecraftâ€™s â€˜unknown coloursâ€ bound in purple and greens akin to both the ocean depths and mysteries from outer space.

9780861661410,From Hell,"""I shall tell you where we are. We're in the most extreme and utter region of the human mind. A dim; subconscious underworld. A radiant abyss where men meet themselves. Hell; Netley. We're in Hell."" Having proved himself peerless in the arena of reinterpreting superheroes; Alan Moore turned his ever-incisive eye to the squalid; enigmatic world of Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders of 1888. Weighing in at 576 pages; From Hell is certainly the most epic of Moore's works and remarkably and is possibly his finest effort yet in a career punctuated by such glorious highlights as Watchmen and V for Vendetta . Going beyond the myriad existing theories; which range from the sublime to the ridiculous; Moore presents an ingenious take on the slaughter. His Ripper's brutal activities are the epicentre of a conspiracy involving the very heart of the British Establishment; including the Freemasons and The Royal Family. A popular claim; which is transformed through Moore's exquisite and thoroughly gripping vision; of the Ripper crimes being the womb from which the 20th century; so enmeshed in the celebrity culture of violence; received its shocking; visceral birth. Bolstered by meticulous research that encompasses a wide spectrum of Ripper studies and myths and coupled with his ability to evoke sympathies in such monstrous characters; Moore has created perhaps the finest examination of the Ripper legacy; observing far beyond society's obsessive need to expose Evil's visage. Ultimately; as Moore observes; Jack's identity and his actions are inconsequential to the manner in which society embraced the Fear: ""It's about us. It's about our minds and how they dance. Jack mirrors our hysterias. Faceless; he is the receptacle for each new social panic."" Eddie Campbell's stunning black and white artwork; replete with a scratchy; dirty sheen; is perfectly matched to the often-unshakeable intensity of Moore's writing. Between them; each murder is rendered in horrifying detail; providing the book's most unnerving scenes; made more so in uncomfortable; yet lyrical moments as when the villain embraces an eviscerated corpse; craving understanding; pleading that they ""are wed in legend; inextricable within eternity"". Though technically a comic; the term hardly begins to describe From Hell's inimitable grandeur and finesse; as it takes the medium to fresh heights of ingenuity and craftsmanship. Moore and Campbell's autopsy on the emaciated corpse of the Ripper myth has divulged a deeply disturbing yet undeniably captivating masterpiece. --Danny Graydon",English,UK,576,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509277098l/23529.jpg,Crossley,2010-05-05,Alan Moore|Eddie Campbell|Pete Mullins,Sequential Art|Graphic Novels|Sequential Art|Comics|Horror|Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction

9780316010660,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,"Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic; Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now; in Blink; he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking; about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers; while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win; while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office; in the classroom; in the kitchen; and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last; based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here; too; are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating; but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",English,USA,296,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440763417l/40102.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1988-01-01,Malcolm Gladwell,Nonfiction|Psychology|Business|Science|Self Help

9780743226720,1776,In this masterful book; David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence - when the whole American cause was riding on their success; without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.Based on extensive research in both American and British archives; 1776 is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks; men of every shape; size; and color; farmers; schoolteachers; shoemakers; no-accounts; and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men; the British commander; William Howe; an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.At the center of the drama; with Washington; are two young American patriots; who; at first; knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green; a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three; and Henry Knox; a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington; who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams; David McCullough's 1776 is another landmark in the literature of American history.,English,USA,386,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1306787560l/1067.jpg,Hachette,1988-01-01,David McCullough,History|Nonfiction|North American Hi...|American History|Historical|Military History|American Revolution

Ambitious; charismatic; and beautiful; Nefertiti is destined to marry Amunhotep; an unstable young pharaoh. It is hoped by all that her strong personality will temper the young Amunhotep's heretical desire to forsake Egypt's ancient gods; overthrow the priests of Amun; and introduce a new sun god for all to worship. From the moment of her arrival in Thebes; Nefertiti is beloved by the people. Her charisma is matched only by her husband's perceived generosity: Amunhotep showers his subjects with lofty promises. The love of the commoners will not be enough; however; if the royal couple is not able to conceive an heir; and as Nefertiti turns her attention to producing a son; she fails to see that the powerful priests; along with the military; are plotting against her husband's rule. The only person wise enough to recognize the shift in political winds--and brave enough to tell the queen--is her younger sister; Mutnodjmet.Observant and contemplative; Mutnodjmet has never shared her sister's desire for power. She yearns for a quiet existence away from family duty and the intrigues of court. Her greatest hope is to share her life with the general who has won her heart.

And it happened because Julian valued something important in himself and saw in the other three something he also valued.Mrs. Olinski; returning to teaching after having been injured in an automobile accident; found that her Academic Bowl team became her answer to finding confidence and success.

Manners and morality are also victims of Wilde's sharp wit in Lady Windermere's Fan; A Woman of No Importance and An Ideal Husband; in which snobbery and hypocrisy are laid bare. In SalomÃ© and A Florentine Tragedy; Wilde makes powerful use of historical settings to explore the complex relationship between sex and power. The range of these plays displays Wilde's delight in artifice; masks and disguises; and reveals the pretentions of the social world in which he himself played such a dazzling and precarious part.Richard Allen Cave's introduction and notes discuss the themes of the plays and Wilde's innovative methods of staging.

9780415254080,Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,Perhaps the most important work of philosophy written in the twentieth century; Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus was the only philosophical work that Ludwig Wittgenstein published during his lifetime. Written in short; carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme brilliance; it captured the imagination of a generation of philosophers. For Wittgenstein; logic was something we use to conquer a reality which is in itself both elusive and unobtainable. He famously summarized the book in the following words: 'What can be said at all can be said clearly; and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.' David Pears and Brian McGuinness received the highest praise for their meticulous translation. The work is prefaced by Bertrand Russell's original introduction to the first English edition.,English,USA,142,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1396830687l/12075.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2012-08-09,Ludwig Wittgenstein,Philosophy|Nonfiction|Philosophy|Logic|Humanities|Language

9780767919360,The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid,"From one of the most beloved and bestselling authors in the English language; a vivid; nostalgic; and utterly hilarious memoir of growing up in the 1950sBill Bryson was born in the middle of the American centuryâ€951â€”in the middle of the United Statesâ€”Des Moines; Iowaâ€”in the middle of the largest generation in American historyâ€”the baby boomers. As one of the best and funniest writers alive; he is perfectly positioned to mine his memories of a totally all-American childhood for 24-carat memoir gold. Like millions of his generational peers; Bill Bryson grew up with a rich fantasy life as a superhero. In his case; he ran around his house and neighborhood with an old football jersey with a thunderbolt on it and a towel about his neck that served as his cape; leaping tall buildings in a single bound and vanquishing awful evildoers (and morons)â€”in his headâ€”as ""The Thunderbolt Kid."" Using this persona as a springboard; Bill Bryson re-creates the life of his family and his native city in the 1950s in all its transcendent normalityâ€”a life at once completely familiar to us all and as far away and unreachable as another galaxy. It was; he reminds us; a happy time; when automobiles and televisions and appliances (not to mention nuclear weapons) grew larger and more numerous with each passing year; and DDT; cigarettes; and the fallout from atmospheric testing were considered harmless or even good for you. He brings us into the life of his loving but eccentric family; including affectionate portraits of his father; a gifted sportswriter for the local paper and dedicated practitioner of isometric exercises; and OF his mother; whose job as the home furnishing editor for the same paper left her little time for practicing the domestic arts at home. The many readers of Bill Brysonâ€™s earlier classic; A Walk in the Woods; will greet the reappearance in these pages of the immortal Stephen Katz; seen hijacking literally boxcar loads of beer. He is joined in the Bryson gallery of immortal characters by the demonically clever Willoughby brothers; who apply their scientific skills and can-do attitude to gleefully destructive ends. Warm and laugh-out-loud funny; and full of his inimitable; pitch-perfect observations; The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid is as wondrous a book as Bill Bryson has ever written. It will enchant anyone who has ever been young.",English,UK,288,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389761724l/10538.jpg,Penguin,1988-01-01,Bill Bryson,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Humor|Biography|Biography|Autobiography

With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak; it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..."" In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours; and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner; Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.In 1820; the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later; in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific; it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew; fearing cannibals on the islands to the west; made for the 3;000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions; the survivors clung to life as one by one; they succumbed to hunger; thirst; disease; and fear.In the Heart of the Sea tells perhaps the greatest sea story ever. Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost; unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told; the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature; drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources; including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class; race; and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville; In the Heart of the Sea will endure as a vital work of American history.",English,USA,302,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335902168l/17780.jpg,Crossley,2012-08-09,Nathaniel Philbrick,Nonfiction|History|Adventure|Historical|Adventure|Survival
9780575067080,The Pianist: The Extraordinary Story of One Man's Survival in Warsaw; 1939â€5,The last live broadcast on Polish Radio; on September 23; 1939; was Chopin's Nocturne in C# Minor; played by a young pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman; until his playing was interrupted by German shelling. It was the same piece and the same pianist; when broadcasting resumed six years later. The Pianist is Szpilman's account of the years inbetween; of the death and cruelty inflicted on the Jews of Warsaw and on Warsaw itself; related with a dispassionate restraint borne of shock. Szpilman; now 88; has not looked at his description since he wrote it in 1946 (the same time as Primo Levi's If This Is A Man?; it is too personally painful. The rest of us have no such excuse.  Szpilman's family were deported to Treblinka; where they were exterminated; he survived only because a music-loving policeman recognised him. This was only the first in a series of fatefully lucky escapes that littered his life as he hid among the rubble and corpses of the Warsaw Ghetto; growing thinner and hungrier; yet condemned to live. Ironically it was a German officer; Wilm Hosenfeld; who saved Szpilman's life by bringing food and an eiderdown to the derelict ruin where he discovered him. Hosenfeld died seven years later in a Stalingrad labour camp; but portions of his diary; reprinted here; tell of his outraged incomprehension of the madness and evil he witnessed; thereby establishing an effective counterpoint to ground the nightmarish vision of the pianist in a desperate reality. Szpilman originally published his account in Poland in 1946; but it was almost immediately withdrawn by Stalin's Polish minions as it unashamedly described collaborations by Lithuanians; Ukrainians; Poles and Jews with the Nazis. In 1997 it was published in Germany after Szpilman's son found it on his father's bookcase. This admirably robust translation by Anthea Bell is the first in the English language. There were 3;500;000 Jews in Poland before the Nazi occupation; after it there were 240;000. Wladyslaw Szpilman's extraordinary account of his own miraculous survival offers a voice across the years for the faceless millions who lost their lives. --David Vincent,English,UK,222,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1491050715l/128066.jpg,Hachette,2012-08-09,WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw Szpilman|Anthea Bell,Nonfiction|History|World War II|Holocaust|Biography|War|Autobiography|Memoir

9780345440780,The Redemption of Althalus,The Redemption of Althalus is the first stand-alone; single-volume high fantasy saga written by the bestselling husband and wife team of David and Leigh Eddings. Their previous beloved series include the Belgariad; the Malloreon; and the Elenium; and although Althalus is bursting with all the daring escapades their multitude of fans expect; it is also an engaging departure for the authors. Althalus is a grand adventure that is bound to enthrall readers of the authors' previous; multivolume epics; but it features a precision of plot and language that can be achieved only by having an actual resolution. Althalus is a young thief and occasional killer known for his skill and incredible luck. A number of capers end without much monetary reward for him; until he stumbles into a shrine built to the fertility goddess Dweia. Soon afterward he meets with the wizard Ghend; who hires him to steal the Book; a magical tome that can be found in the bizarre House at the End of the World. There; Althalus discovers Dweia in the form of a black cat and learns that she has chosen him to aid her in a war against Ghend and her evil brother; the destroyer god Daeva. Together Althalus and Dweia use the power of the Book and gather together a small team of questionable heroes who must battle Ghend's supernatural forces and armies. The thief Althalus can only hope his luck holds out for this one last task; since the very fate of humanity is at stake.A stand-alone epic fantasy is a rarity in the modern-day publishing world and a concept that should be embraced more often. The Redemption of Althalus gives us all the action; sorcery; humor; and soaring imagination of a grand series but doesn't leave any loose threads; fractured subplots; or loss of momentum. A great deal of fun action and generally good-natured exploits are punctuated by the authors' usual satire on religion and high society. In one clever turn; Althalus enters a city where the wealthy are forced to hide their riches and live even worse than the poor in order to avoid taxation. Althalus is well-polished and smoothly constructed; with real storytelling muscle and a gratifying finale. The Eddingses should be praised for their willingness to put a cap on this particular story in an effort to offer other wonderfully developed worlds to their readers.,English,USA,800,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403185455l/110692.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1988-01-01,David Eddings|Leigh Eddings,Fantasy|Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy

This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a yearlong journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool toward the upper echelons of New York society and the executive suites of CondÃ© Nast--rarefied environs where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve.

9780553805380,The Grand Design,THE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLDâ€™S GREAT THINKERSâ€”A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFEÂ When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And; finally; is the apparent â€œgrand designâ€of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motionâ€”or does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself; once the province of philosophy; now occupy the territory where scientists; philosophers; and theologians meetâ€”if only to disagree. In their new book; Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe; in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory; the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history; but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole; this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the â€œtop-downâ€approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it; rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe; and show how quantum theory predicts the â€œmultiverseâ€â€”the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing; each with different laws of nature.Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality; posing a â€œmodel-dependentâ€theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory; an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete â€œtheory of everything.â€If confirmed; they write; it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for; and the ultimate triumph of human reason.A succinct; startling; and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems; The Grand Design is a book that will informâ€”and provokeâ€”like no other.,English,USA,199,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320558363l/8520362.jpg,Harper Collins,2012-08-09,Stephen Hawking|Leonard Mlodinow,Science|Nonfiction|Science|Physics|Philosophy|Science|Popular Science

They never get caught. And they know they never will. Until one disastrous summer afternoon.On that day; what begins as a harmless scheme goes horribly wrong. And the four find themselves facing a year's imprisonment in the Wilkinson Home for Boys. The oldest of them is fifteen; the youngest twelve. What happens to them over the course of that year -- brutal beatings; unimaginable humiliation -- will change their lives forever. Years later; one becomes a lawyer. One a reporter.

9781400063510,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and; after the fact; we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random; and more predictable; than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb; black swans underlie almost everything about our world; from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer; according to Taleb; is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we donâ€™t know. We are; therefore; unable to truly estimate opportunities; too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify; narrate; and categorize; and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the â€œimpossible.â€For years; Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential; while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now; in this revelatory book; Taleb explains everything we know about what we donâ€™t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.Elegant; startling; and universal in its applications The Black Swan will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer; with wit; irreverence; and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. The Black Swan is a landmark book â€itself a black swan.The book also contains a 4-page glossary; 19 pages of notes; and; a 28-page bibliography in addition to an index.,English,USA,366,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386925471l/242472.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2010-05-05,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Nonfiction|Economics|Business|Philosophy|Science|Psychology|Economics|Finance

9781921351430,Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance,Nine years before the Senate campaign that made him one of the most influential and compelling voices in American politics; Barack Obama published this lyrical; unsentimental; and powerfully affecting memoir; which became a #1 New York Times bestseller when it was reissued in 2004. Dreams from My Father tells the story of Obamaâ€™s struggle to understand the forces that shaped him as the son of a black African father and white American motherâ€”a struggle that takes him from the American heartland to the ancestral home of his great-aunt in the tiny African village of Alego. Obama opens his story in New York; where he hears that his fatherâ€”a figure he knows more as a myth than as a manâ€”has died in a car accident. The news triggers a chain of memories as Barack retraces his familyâ€™s unusual history: the migration of his motherâ€™s family from small-town Kansas to the Hawaiian islands; the love that develops between his mother and a promising young Kenyan student; a love nurtured by youthful innocence and the integrationist spirit of the early sixties; his fatherâ€™s departure from Hawaii when Barack was two; as the realities of race and power reassert themselves; and Barackâ€™s own awakening to the fears and doubts that exist not just between the larger black and white worlds but within himself.Propelled by a desire to understand both the forces that shaped him and his fatherâ€™s legacy; Barack moves to Chicago to work as a community organizer. There; against the backdrop of tumultuous political and racial conflict; he works to turn back the mounting despair of the inner city. His story becomes one with those of the people he works with as he learns about the value of community; the necessity of healing old wounds; and the possibility of faith in the midst of adversity.Barackâ€™s journey comes full circle in Kenya; where he finally meets the African side of his family and confronts the bitter truth of his fatherâ€™s life. Traveling through a country racked by brutal poverty and tribal conflict; but whose people are sustained by a spirit of endurance and hope; Barack discovers that he is inescapably bound to brothers and sisters living an ocean awayâ€”and that by embracing their common struggles he can finally reconcile his divided inheritance.A searching meditation on the meaning of identity in America; Dreams from My Father might be the most revealing portrait we have of a major American leaderâ€”a man who is playing; and will play; an increasingly prominent role in healing a fractious and fragmented nation.,English,USA,453,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1352340675l/88061.jpg,Hachette,1988-01-01,Barack Obama,Nonfiction|Biography|Autobiography|Memoir|Politics|Biography|Autobiography

9780006280840,Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life,"Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life is a partial autobiography describing Lewis' conversion to Christianity. The book overall contains less detail concerning specific events than typical autobiographies. This is because his purpose in writing wasn't primarily historical. His aim was to identify & describe the events surrounding his accidental discovery of & consequent search for the phenomenon he labelled ""Joy"". This word was the best translation he could make of the German idea of Sehnsucht; longing. That isn't to say the book is devoid of information about his life. He recounts his early years with a measure of amusement sometimes mixed with pain. However; while he does describe his life; the principal theme of the book is Joy as he defined it. This Joy was a longing so intense for something so good & so high up it couldn't be explained with words. He's struck with ""stabs of joy"" throughout life. He finally finds what it's for at the end. He writes about his experiences at Malvern College in 1913; aged 15. Though he described the school as ""a very furnace of impure loves"" he defended the practice as being ""the only chink left thru which something spontaneous & uncalculating could creep in."" The book's last two chapters cover the end of his search as he moves from atheism to theism & then from theism to Christianity. He ultimately discovers the true nature & purpose of Joy & its place in his own life. The book isn't connected with his unexpected marriage in later life to Joy Gresham. The marriage occurred long after the period described; though not long after the book was published. His friends were quick to notice the coincidence; remarking he'd really been ""Surprised by Joy"". ""Surprised by Joy"" is also an allusion to Wordsworth's poem; ""Surprised by Joy-Impatient As The Wind""; relating an incident when Wordsworth forgot the death of his beloved daughter.",English,UK,185,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381407473l/121732.jpg,Macmillan,1988-01-01,C.S.

Now Addie; desperate for answers; must look into her heart -- and into Jack's lies and shadowy secrets -- for evidence that will condemn or redeem the man she has come to love.,English,USA,434,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344397557l/10915.jpg,Random House,2012-08-09,Jodi Picoult,Fiction|Contemporary|Womens Fiction|Chick Lit|Romance
9780330419120,Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,"A multilayered; bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion; savage violence; polygamy; and unyielding faith. This is vintage Krakauer; an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.Jon Krakauerâ€™s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In Under The Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith; he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers; Ron and Dan Lafferty; who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this ""divinely inspired"" crime; Krakauer constructs a multilayered; bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion; savage violence; polygamy; and unyielding faith. Along the way; he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of Americaâ€™s fastest-growing religion; and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West; Canada; and Mexico; where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City; the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ""plural wives;"" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties); fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers; and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire; sparing only their most obedient adherents.Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonismâ€™s violent past; Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States; and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer; an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.",English,USA,369,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356441391l/10847.jpg,Crossley,1970-02-01,Jon Krakauer,Nonfiction|Religion|History|Crime|True Crime|Mystery|Crime

In the summer before Cullen's senior year; a nominally-depressed birdwatcher named John Barling thinks he spots a species of woodpecker thought to be extinct since the 1940s in Lily; Arkansas. His rediscovery of the so-called Lazarus Woodpecker sparks a flurry of press and woodpecker-mania. Soon all the kids are getting woodpecker haircuts and everyone's eating ""Lazarus burgers."" But as absurd as the town's carnival atmosphere has become; nothing is more startling than the realization that Cullenâ€™s sensitive; gifted fifteen-year-old brother Gabriel has suddenly and inexplicably disappeared. While Cullen navigates his way through a summer of finding and losing love; holding his fragile family together; and muddling his way into adulthood; a young missionary in Africa; who has lost his faith; is searching for any semblance of meaning wherever he can find it. As distant as the two stories seem at the start; they are thoughtfully woven ever closer together and through masterful plotting; brought face to face in a surprising and harrowing climax. Complex but truly extraordinary; tinged with melancholy and regret; comedy and absurdity; this novel finds wonder in the ordinary and emerges as ultimately hopeful. It's about a lot more than what Cullen calls; â€œthat damn bird.â€Itâ€™s about the dream of second chances.",English,UK,228,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1330581469l/8563789.jpg,Harper Collins,2010-05-05,John Corey Whaley,Young Adult|Contemporary|Fiction|Realistic Fiction|Mystery

9780141439860,Shirley,"Following the tremendous popular success of Jane Eyre; which earned her lifelong notoriety as a moral revolutionary; Charlotte BrontÃ« vowed to write a sweeping social chronicle that focused on ""something real and unromantic as Monday morning."" Set in the industrializing England of the Napoleonic wars and Luddite revolts of 1811-12; Shirley (1849) is the story of two contrasting heroines. One is the shy Caroline Helstone; who is trapped in the oppressive atmosphere of a Yorkshire rectory and whose bare life symbolizes the plight of single women in the nineteenth century. The other is the vivacious Shirley Keeldar; who inherits a local estate and whose wealth liberates her from convention.A work that combines social commentary with the more private preoccupations of Jane Eyre; Shirley demonstrates the full range of BrontÃ«'s literary talent. ""Shirley is a revolutionary novel;"" wrote BrontÃ« biographer Lyndall Gordon. ""Shirley follows Jane Eyre as a new exemplar but so much a forerunner of the feminist of the later twentieth century that it is hard to believe in her actual existence in 1811-12. She is a theoretic possibility: what a woman might be if she combined independence and means of her own with intellect. Charlotte BrontÃ« imagined a new form of power; equal to that of men; in a confident young woman [whose] extraordinary freedom has accustomed her to think for herself....Shirley [is] BrontÃ«'s most feminist novel.""",English,UK,624,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1422609409l/31168.jpg,Hachette,2010-05-05,Charlotte BrontÃ«|Lucasta Miller|collaborative|Jessica Cox,Classics|Fiction|Romance|Literature|19th Century|Historical|Historical Fiction

Engaging candidly and movingly with his religious struggles; his ill-fated search for love; his attacks of mental illness and his relation with his brother Theo; the letters contradict the popular myth of van Gogh as an anti-social madman and a martyr to art; showing instead a man of great emotional and spiritual depths. Above all; they stand as an intense personal narrative of artistic development and a unique account of the process of creation.The letters are linked by explanatory biographical passages; revealing van Gogh's inner journey as well as the outer facts of his life. This edition also includes the drawings that originally illustrated the letters.Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890) was born in Holland. In 1885 he painted his first masterpiece; The Potato Eaters; a haunting scene of domestic poverty. A year later he began studying in Paris; where he met Gauguin; Toulouse-Lautrec and Seurat; who became very important influences on his work. In 1888 he left Paris for the Provencal landscape at Arles; the subject of many of his best works; including Sunflowers.If you enjoyed The Letters of Vincent van Gogh; you might also like 100 Artists Manifestos; available in Penguin Modern Classics.'If there was ever any doubt that Van Gogh's letters belong beside those great classics of artistic self-revelation; Cellini's autobiography and Delacroix's journal; this excellent new edition dispels it'The Times,English,UK,528,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328110665l/395233.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,Vincent van Gogh|Ronald de Leeuw|Arnold J.

9780743291480,The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible,"From the bestselling author of ""The Know-It-All"" comes a fascinating and timely exploration of religion and the Bible.Raised in a secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world; A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound; reverent and irreverent; personal and universal and will make you see history's most influential book with new eyes.Jacobs's quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire ""Encyclopedia Britannica"" for ""The Know-It-All."" His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer; tends sheep in the Israeli desert; battles idolatry; and tells the absolute truth in all situations - much to his wife's chagrin.Throughout the book; Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah's Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs's extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and challenges. A book that will charm readers both secular and religious; ""The Year of Living Biblically"" is part Cliff Notes to the Bible; part memoir; and part look into worlds unimaginable. Thou shalt not be able to put it down.",English,UK,388,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327977486l/495395.jpg,Random House,2010-05-05,A.J. Jacobs,Nonfiction|Religion|Humor|Autobiography|Memoir

This is the life of MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e; the heaviest drinking; hardest fighting; most oversexed and arrogant band in the world. Their unbelievable exploits are the stuff of rock 'n' roll legend. They nailed the hottest chicks; started the bloodiest fights; partied with the biggest drug dealers; and got to know the inside of every jail cell from California to Japan. They have dedicated an entire career to living life to its extreme; from the greatest fantasies to the darkest tragedies. Tommy married two international sex symbols; Vince killed a man and lost a daughter to cancer; Nikki overdosed; rose from the dead; and then OD'd again the next day; and Mick shot a woman and tried to hang his own brother. But that's just the beginning. Fueled by every drug they could get their hands on and obscene amounts of alcohol; driven by fury and headed straight for hell; MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e raged through two decades; leaving behind a trail of debauched women; trashed hotel rooms; crashed cars; psychotic managers; and broken bones that has left the music industry cringing to this day. All these unspeakable acts; not to mention their dire consequences; are laid bare in The Dirt.Here -- directly from Nikki; Vince; Tommy; and Mick -- is the unexpurgated version of the whole glorious; gut-wrenching story. In these pages; published for the first time anywhere; are Tommy Lee's letters to Pamela Anderson from prison: Mick's confession to having an incurable disease that is slowly killing him; Vince's experience burying his own daughter -- and the train wreck that his life became afterward; and Nikki's anguished struggle to deal with an entire life fueled by anger over his childhood abandonment; his discovery of the family he never knew he had -- and his subsequent loss of them.

9780743477890,Undaunted Courage: The Pioneering First Mission to Explore America's Wild Frontier,'This was much more than a bunch of guys out on an exploring and collecting expedition. This was a military expedition into hostile territory'. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson selected his personal secretary; Captain Meriwether Lewis; to lead a pioneering voyage across the Great Plains and into the Rockies. It was completely uncharted territory; a wild; vast land ruled by the Indians. Charismatic and brave; Lewis was the perfect choice and he experienced the savage North American continent before any other white man. UNDAUNTED COURAGE is the tale of a hero; but it is also a tragedy. Lewis may have received a hero's welcome on his return to Washington in 1806; but his discoveries did not match the president's fantasies of sweeping; fertile plains ripe for the taking. Feeling the expedition had been a failure; Lewis took to drink and piled up debts. Full of colourful characters - Jefferson; the president obsessed with conquering the west; William Clark; the rugged frontiersman; Sacagawea; the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition; Drouillard; the French-Indian hunter - this is one of the great adventure stories of all time and it shot to the top of the US bestseller charts.

Oh; I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office; people tut. Or sometimes they say ""Excuse me; I was here first."" They don't say ""You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity."" That would be a bit strong.

Born in the United States; reared in a series of provisional households in Mexicoâ€”from a coastal island jungle to 1930s Mexico Cityâ€”Harrison Shepherd finds precarious shelter but no sense of home on his thrilling odyssey. Life is whatever he learns from housekeepers who put him to work in the kitchen; errands he runs in the streets; and one fateful day; by mixing plaster for famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. He discovers a passion for Aztec history and meets the exotic; imperious artist Frida Kahlo; who will become his lifelong friend. When he goes to work for Lev Trotsky; an exiled political leader fighting for his life; Shepherd inadvertently casts his lot with art and revolution; newspaper headlines and howling gossip; and a risk of terrible violence. Meanwhile; to the north; the United States will soon be caught up in the internationalist goodwill of World War II.

They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze; on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly; one of them detects a nearly imperceptible patternâ€”and with a slight shift in advertising; Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employeesâ€”how they approach worker safetyâ€”and soon the firm; Alcoa; becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit; award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives; Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change; despite years of trying; while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where; exactly; they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps; Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz; and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King; Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble; Target superstores; Rick Warrenâ€™s Saddleback Church; NFL locker rooms; and the nationâ€™s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success; life and death.At its core; The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly; losing weight; raising exceptional children; becoming more productive; building revolutionary companies and social movements; and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits arenâ€™t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows; by harnessing this new science; we can transform our businesses; our communities; and our lives.,English,USA,375,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366758683l/12609433.jpg,Harper Collins,2010-05-05,Charles Duhigg,Nonfiction|Psychology|Self Help|Business|Self Help|Personal Development|Science|Productivity|Audiobook|Leadership|Sociology

9780812993550,Between the World and Me,In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son; Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nationâ€™s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of â€œrace;â€a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and menâ€”bodies exploited through slavery and segregation; and; today; threatened; locked up; and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coatesâ€™s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his sonâ€”and readersâ€”the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences; from Howard University to Civil War battlefields; from the South Side of Chicago to Paris; from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose childrenâ€™s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative; reimagined history; and fresh; emotionally charged reportage; Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past; bracingly confronts our present; and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.,English,USA,152,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451435027l/25489625.jpg,Hachette,1970-02-01,Ta-Nehisi Coates,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Race|History

Mencken; Lewis Mumford; Rebecca West; Sherwood Anderson; Malcolm Cowley; Alfred Kazin; Constance Rourke; and Mark Schorer.Main Street; the story of an idealistic young woman's attempts to reform her small town; brought Lewis immediate acclaim when it was published in 1920. It remains one of the essential texts of the American scene. Lewis Mumford observed: ""In Main Street an American had at last written of our life with something of the intellectual rigor and critical detachment that had seemed so cruel and unjustified [in Charles Dickens and Matthew Arnold]. Young people had grown up in this environment; suffocated; stultified; helpless; but unable to find any reason for their spiritual discomfort. Mr. Lewis released them.""Sinclair Lewis (1885-1951); was born in Sauk Centre; Minnesota and graduated from Yale in 1907. In 1930 he became the first American recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Main Street (1920) was his first critical and commercial success.

9781400032050,1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,"A groundbreaking study that radically alters our understanding of the Americas before the arrival of the Europeans in 1492.Traditionally; Americans learned in school that the ancestors of the people who inhabited the Western Hemisphere at the time of Columbusâ€™s landing had crossed the Bering Strait twelve thousand years ago; existed mainly in small; nomadic bands; and lived so lightly on the land that the Americas was; for all practical purposes; still a vast wilderness. But as Charles C. Mann now makes clear; archaeologists and anthropologists have spent the last thirty years proving these and many other long-held assumptions wrong.In a book that startles and persuades; Mann reveals how a new generation of researchers equipped with novel scientific techniques came to previously unheard-of conclusions. Among them:In 1491 there were probably more people living in the Americas than in Europe.Certain citiesâ€“such as TenochtitlÃ¡n; the Aztec capitalâ€“were far greater in population than any contemporary European city. Furthermore; TenochtitlÃ¡n; unlike any capital in Europe at that time; had running water; beautiful botanical gardens; and immaculately clean streets.The earliest cities in the Western Hemisphere were thriving before the Egyptians built the great pyramids.Pre-Columbian Indians in Mexico developed corn by a breeding process so sophisticated that the journal Science recently described it as ""manâ€™s first; and perhaps the greatest; feat of genetic engineering.""Amazonian Indians learned how to farm the rain forest without destroying itâ€“a process scientists are studying today in the hope of regaining this lost knowledge.Native Americans transformed their land so completely that Europeans arrived in a hemisphere already massively ""landscaped"" by human beings.Mann sheds clarifying light on the methods used to arrive at these new visions of the pre-Columbian Americas and how they have affected our understanding of our history and our thinking about the environment. His book is an exciting and learned account of scientific inquiry and revelation.",English,USA,541,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327865228l/39020.jpg,Harper Collins,1970-02-01,Charles C.

9780517548230,Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest & Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics,A million copy seller; Henry Hazlittâ€™s Economics in One Lesson is a classic economic primer. But it is also much more; having become a fundamental influence on modern â€œlibertarianâ€economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the â€œAustrian School;â€which includes Carl Menger; Ludwig von Mises; Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek; and others; Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993); was a libertarian philosopher; an economist; and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine; an influential libertarian publication.Â  Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson; his seminal work; in 1946. Concise and instructive; it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.Many current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlittâ€™s focus on non-governmental solutions; strong â€and strongly reasoned â€anti-deficit position; and general emphasis on free markets; economic liberty of individuals; and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson; every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.,English,UK,218,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320423284l/3028.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Henry Hazlitt,Economics|Nonfiction|Politics|Business|Economics|Finance

9780345494860,Innocent Traitor,BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Alison Weir'sÂ Mary Boleyn.I am now a condemned traitor . . . I am to die when I have hardly begun to live. Historical expertise marries page-turning fiction in Alison Weirâ€™s enthralling debut novel; breathing new life into one of the most significant and tumultuous periods of the English monarchy. It is the story of Lady Jane Greyâ€“â€œthe Nine Daysâ€Queenâ€â€“a fifteen-year-old girl who unwittingly finds herself at the center of the religious and civil unrest that nearly toppled the fabled House of Tudor during the sixteenth century. The child of a scheming father and a ruthless mother; for whom she is merely a pawn in a dynastic game with the highest stakes; Jane Grey was born during the harrowingly turbulent period between Anne Boleynâ€™s beheading and the demise of Janeâ€™s infamous great-uncle; King Henry VIII. With the premature passing of Janeâ€s adolescent cousin; and Henryâ€™s successor; King Edward VI; comes a struggle for supremacy fueled by political machinations and lethal religious fervor.  Unabashedly honest and exceptionally intelligent; Jane possesses a sound strength of character beyond her years that equips her to weather the vicious storm. And though she has no ambitions to rule; preferring to immerse herself in books and religious studies; she is forced to accept the crown; and by so doing sets off a firestorm of intrigue; betrayal; and tragedy. Alison Weir uses her unmatched skills as a historian to enliven the many dynamic characters of this majestic drama. Along with Lady Jane Grey; Weir vividly renders her devious parents; her much-loved nanny; the benevolent Queen Katherine Parr; Janeâ€™s ambitious cousins; the Catholic â€œBloodyâ€Mary; who will stop at nothing to seize the throne; and the Protestant and future queen Elizabeth. Readers venture inside royal drawing rooms and bedchambers to witness the power-grabbing that swirls around Lady Jane Grey from the day of her birth to her unbearably poignant death.

9780593061730,The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution,Charles Darwinâ€™s masterpiece; On the Origin of Species; shook society to its core on publication in 1859. Darwin was only too aware of the storm his theory of evolution would provoke but he would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians; yet millions of people continue to question its veracity.In The Greatest Show on Earth Richard Dawkins takes on creationists; including followers of â€˜Intelligent Designâ€and all those who question the fact of evolution through natural selection. Like a detective arriving on the scene of a crime; he sifts through fascinating layers of scientific facts and disciplines to build a cast-iron case: from the living examples of natural selection in birds and insects; the â€˜time clocksâ€of trees and radioactive dating that calibrate a timescale for evolution; the fossil record and the traces of our earliest ancestors; to confirmation from molecular biology and genetics. All of this; and much more; bears witness to the truth of evolution.The Greatest Show on Earth comes at a critical time: systematic opposition to the fact of evolution is now flourishing as never before; especially in America. In Britain and elsewhere in the world; teachers witness insidious attempts to undermine the status of science in their classrooms. Richard Dawkins provides unequivocal evidence that boldly and comprehensively rebuts such nonsense. At the same time he shares with us his palpable love of the natural world and the essential role that science plays in its interpretation. Written with elegance; wit and passion; it is hard-hitting; absorbing and totally convincing.,English,UK,470,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1302127919l/6117055.jpg,Harper Collins,2002-01-02,Richard Dawkins,Science|Nonfiction|Biology|Evolution|Science|Biology|Religion

9780618001900,King Leopold's Ghost,In the 1880s; as the European powers were carving up Africa; King Leopold II of Belgium seized for himself the vast and mostly unexplored territory surrounding the Congo River. Carrying out a genocidal plundering of the Congo; he looted its rubber; brutalized its people; and ultimately slashed its population by ten million--all the while shrewdly cultivating his reputation as a great humanitarian. Heroic efforts to expose these crimes eventually led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century; in which everyone from Mark Twain to the Archbishop of Canterbury participated. King Leopold's Ghost is the haunting account of a megalomaniac of monstrous proportions; a man as cunning; charming; and cruel as any of the great Shakespearean villains. It is also the deeply moving portrait of those who fought Leopold: a brave handful of missionaries; travelers; and young idealists who went to Africa for work or adventure and unexpectedly found themselves witnesses to a holocaust. Adam Hochschild brings this largely untold story alive with the wit and skill of a Barbara Tuchman. Like her; he knows that history often provides a far richer cast of characters than any novelist could invent. Chief among them is Edmund Morel; a young British shipping agent who went on to lead the international crusade against Leopold. Another hero of this tale; the Irish patriot Roger Casement; ended his life on a London gallows. Two courageous black Americans; George Washington Williams and William Sheppard; risked much to bring evidence of the Congo atrocities to the outside world. Sailing into the middle of the story was a young Congo River steamboat officer named Joseph Conrad. And looming above them all; the duplicitous billionaire King Leopold II. With great power and compassion; King Leopold's Ghost will brand the tragedy of the Congo--too long forgotten--onto the conscience of the West,English,USA,306,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348621563l/347610.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,Adam Hochschild,History|Nonfiction|Cultural|Africa|Biography|Politics

9780142003340,The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature,In The Blank Slate; Steven Pinker explores the idea of human nature and its moral; emotional; and political colorings. He shows how many intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature by embracing three linked dogmas: the Blank Slate (the mind has no innate traits); the Noble Savage (people are born good and corrupted by society); and the Ghost in the Machine (each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden; so their defenders have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are now challenging them.Pinker injects calm and rationality into these debates by showing that equality; progress; responsibility; and purpose have nothing to fear from discoveries about a rich human nature. He disarms even the most menacing threats with clear thinking; common sense; and pertinent facts from science and history. Despite its popularity among intellectuals during much of the twentieth century; he argues; the doctrine of the Blank Slate may have done more harm than good. It denies our common humanity and our individual preferences; replaces hardheaded analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans; and distorts our understanding of government; violence; parenting; and the arts.Pinker shows that an acknowledgement of human nature that is grounded in science and common sense; far from being dangerous; can complement insights about the human condition made by millennia of artists and philosophers. All this is done in the style that earned his previous books many prizes and worldwide acclaim: wit; lucidity; and insight into matters great and small.,English,USA,528,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386925462l/5752.jpg,Macmillan,2010-05-05,Steven Pinker,Psychology|Science|Nonfiction|Philosophy|Sociology|Science|Biology

Swift suggests in his essay that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. By doing this he mocks the authority of the British officials. A Modest Proposal is included in many literature programs as an example of early modern western satire. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language; lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses.

9781416591050,Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches; the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History,"In the tradition of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee; a stunningly vivid historical account of the forty-year battle between Comanche Indians and white settlers for control of the American West; centering on Quanah; the greatest Comanche chief of them all.S. C. Gwynneâ€™s Empire of the Summer Moon spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches; the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West: the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah; who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches. Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux; it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined just how and when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled backward by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. So effective were the Comanches that they forced the creation of the Texas Rangers and account for the advent of the new weapon specifically designed to fight them: the six-gun. The war with the Comanches lasted four decades; in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynneâ€™s exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism; the Civil War; the destruction of the buffalo herds; and the arrival of the railroadsâ€”a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being. Against this backdrop Gwynne presents the compelling drama of Cynthia Ann Parker; a lovely nine-year-old girl with cornflower-blue eyes who was kidnapped by Comanches from the far Texas frontier in 1836. She grew to love her captors and became infamous as the ""White Squaw"" who refused to return until her tragic capture by Texas Rangers in 1860. More famous still was her son Quanah; a warrior who was never defeated and whose guerrilla wars in the Texas Panhandle made him a legend. S. C. Gwynneâ€™s account of these events is meticulously researched; intellectually provocative; and; above all; thrillingly told.",English,USA,384,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1395176404l/7648269.jpg,Hachette,1988-01-01,S.C.

9780066620990,Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't,To find the keys to greatness; Collins's 21-person research team read and coded 6;000 articles; generated more than 2;000 pages of interview transcripts and created 384 megabytes of computer data in a five-year project. The findings will surprise many readers and; quite frankly; upset others.The ChallengeBuilt to Last; the defining management study of the nineties; showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies; mediocre companies; even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The StudyFor years; this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so; what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?The StandardsUsing tough benchmarks; Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap; the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years; better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies; including Coca-Cola; Intel; General Electric; and Merck. The ComparisonsThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? The FindingsThe findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship; you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.,English,UK,320,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435813395l/76865.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1970-02-01,James C.

9780226320620,The Road to Serfdom,"A classic work in political philosophy; intellectual and cultural history; and economics; The Road to Serfdom has inspired and infuriated politicians; scholars; and general readers for half a century. Originally published in England in the spring of 1944â€”when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin; and Albert Einstein subscribed lock; stock; and barrel to the socialist programâ€”The Road to Serfdom was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek; the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of nazi Germany and fascist Italy.First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18; 1944; The Road to Serfdom garnered immediate attention from the public; politicians; and scholars alike. The first printing of 2;000 copies was exhausted instantly; and within six months more than 30;000 were sold. In April of 1945; Reader's Digest published a condensed version of the book; and soon thereafter the Book-of-the-Month Club distributed this condensation to more than 600;000 readers. A perennial best-seller; the book has sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States; not including the British edition or the nearly twenty translations into such languages as German; French; Dutch; Swedish; and Japanese; and not to mention the many underground editions produced in Eastern Europe before the fall of the iron curtain.After thirty-two printings in the United States; The Road to Serfdom has established itself alongside the works of Alexis de Tocqueville; John Stuart Mill; and George Orwell for its timeless meditation on the relation between individual liberty and government authority. This fiftieth anniversary edition; with a new introduction by Milton Friedman; commemorates the enduring influence of The Road to Serfdom on the ever-changing political and social climates of the twentieth century; from the rise of socialism after World War II to the Reagan and Thatcher ""revolutions"" in the 1980s and the transitions in Eastern Europe from communism to capitalism in the 1990s.F. A. Hayek (1899-1992); recipient of the Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974; was a pioneer in monetary theory and the principal proponent of libertarianism in the twentieth century.On the first American edition of The Road to Serfdom:""One of the most important books of our generation. . . . It restates for our time the issue between liberty and authority with the power and rigor of reasoning with which John Stuart Mill stated the issue for his own generation in his great essay On Liberty. . . . It is an arresting call to all well-intentioned planners and socialists; to all those who are sincere democrats and liberals at heart to stop; look and listen.""â€”Henry Hazlitt; New York Times Book Review; September 1944""In the negative part of Professor Hayek's thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too oftenâ€”at any rate; it is not being said nearly often enoughâ€”that collectivism is not inherently democratic; but; on the contrary; gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of.""â€”George Orwell; Collected Essays",English,USA,274,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327787673l/299215.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2002-01-02,Friedrich A.

9780195168950,Battle Cry of Freedom,"Filled with fresh interpretations and information; puncturing old myths and challenging new ones; Battle Cry of Freedom will unquestionably become the standard one-volume history of the Civil War. James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political; social; and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight; the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War--the Dred Scott decision; the Lincoln-Douglas debates; John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry--and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles; the strategic maneuvering on both sides; the politics; and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s; the origins of the Republican Party; the causes of secession; internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South; and the reasons for the Union's victory. The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776; while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually; the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war--slavery--and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This ""new birth of freedom;"" as Lincoln called it; constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict. This authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing ""second American Revolution"" we call the Civil War; a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.",English,UK,867,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388185755l/35100.jpg,Hachette,2010-05-05,James M.

9780553805090,The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,Here is THE book recounting the life and times of one of the most respected men in the world; Warren Buffett. The legendary Omaha investor has never written a memoir; but now he has allowed one writer; Alice Schroeder; unprecedented access to explore directly with him and with those closest to him his work; opinions; struggles; triumphs; follies; and wisdom. The result is the personally revealing and complete biography of the man known everywhere as â€œThe Oracle of Omaha.â€Although the media track him constantly; Buffett himself has never told his full life story. His reality is private; especially by celebrity standards. Indeed; while the homespun persona that the public sees is true as far as it goes; it goes only so far. Warren Buffett is an array of paradoxes. He set out to prove that nice guys can finish first. Over the years he treated his investors as partners; acted as their steward; and championed honesty as an investor; CEO; board member; essayist; and speaker. At the same time he became the worldâ€™s richest man; all from the modest Omaha headquarters of his company Berkshire Hathaway. None of this fits the term â€œsimple.â€When Alice Schroeder met Warren Buffett she was an insurance industry analyst and a gifted writer known for her keen perception and business acumen. Her writings on finance impressed him; and as she came to know him she realized that while much had been written on the subject of his investing style; no one had moved beyond that to explore his larger philosophy; which is bound up in a complex personality and the details of his life. Out of this came his decision to cooperate with her on the book about himself that he would never write.Never before has Buffett spent countless hours responding to a writerâ€™s questions; talking; giving complete access to his wife; children; friends; and business associatesâ€”opening his files; recalling his childhood. It was an act of courage; as The Snowball makes immensely clear. Being human; his own life; like most lives; has been a mix of strengths and frailties. Yet notable though his wealth may be; Buffettâ€™s legacy will not be his ranking on the scorecard of wealth; it will be his principles and ideas that have enriched peopleâ€™s lives. This book tells you why Warren Buffett is the most fascinating American success story of our time.,English,USA,929,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320458276l/2054761.jpg,Penguin,2010-05-05,Alice Schroeder,Biography|Business|Nonfiction|Economics|Finance

Now; a quarter century after The Joke was first published and several years after the collapse of the Soviet-imposed Czechoslovak regime; it becomes easier to put such implications into perspective in favor of valuing the book (and all Kundera 's work) as what it truly is: great; stirring literature that sheds new light on the eternal themes of human existence.The present edition provides English-language readers an important further means toward revaluation of The Joke. For reasons he describes in his Author's Note; Milan Kundera devoted much time to creating (with the assistance of his American publisher-editor) a completely revised translation that reflects his original as closely as any translation possibly can: reflects it in its fidelity not only to the words and syntax but also to the characteristic dictions and tonalities of the novel's narrators.

We think we're making smart; rational choices. But are we?In a series of illuminating; often surprising experiments; MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research; Ariely explains how expectations; emotions; social norms; and other invisible; seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day; but we make the same ""types"" of mistakes; Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay; underestimate; and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want; and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us ""predictably"" irrational.From drinking coffee to losing weight; from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner; Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions.

Forced from power; dogged by assassins; and prematurely aged and wasted by a fatal illness; the General is still a remarkably vital and mercurial man. He seems to remain alive by the sheer force of will that led him to so many victories in the battlefields and love affairs of his past.

9780671203240,Why I Am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects,"Dedicated as few men have been to the life of reason; Bertrand Russell has always been concerned with the basic questions to which religion also addresses itself -- questions about man's place in the universe and the nature of the good life; questions that involve life after death; morality; freedom; education; and sexual ethics. He brings to his treatment of these questions the same courage; scrupulous logic; and lofty wisdom for which his other work as philosopher; writer; and teacher has been famous. These qualities make the essays included in this book perhaps the most graceful and moving presentation of the freethinker's position since the days of Hume and Voltaire.  ""I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue;"" Russell declares in his Preface; and his reasoned opposition to any system or dogma which he feels may shackle man's mind runs through all the essays in this book; whether they were written as early as 1899 or as late as 1954.  The book has been edited; with Lord Russell's full approval and cooperation; by Professor Paul Edwards of the Philosophy Department of New York University. In an Appendix; Professor Edwards contributes a full account of the highly controversial ""Bertrand Russell Case"" of 1940; in which Russell was judicially declared ""unfit"" to teach philosophy at the College of the City of New York.  Whether the reader shares or rejects Bertrand Russell's views; he will find this book an invigorating challenge to set notions; a masterly statement of a philosophical position; and a pure joy to read.",English,USA,266,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347925703l/472025.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Bertrand Russell|Paul  Edwards,Philosophy|Religion|Nonfiction|Religion|Atheism|Writing|Essays

Julian English is a man who squanders what fate gave him. He lives on the right side of the tracks; with a country club membership and a wife who loves him. His decline and fall; over the course of just 72 hours around Christmas; is a matter of too much spending; too much liquor; and a couple of reckless gestures.

9789735004100,Maitreyi,"Set in 1930s Calcutta; this is a roman Ã¡ clef of remarkable intimacy. Originally published in Romanian in 1933; this semiautobiographical novel by the world renowned scholar Mircea Eliade details the passionate awakenings of Alain; an ambitious young French engineer flush with colonial pride and prejudice and full of a European fascination with the mysterious subcontinent. Offered the hospitality of a senior Indian colleague; Alain grasps at the chance to discover the authentic India firsthand. He soon finds himself enchanted by his host's daughter; the lovely and inscrutable Maitreyi; a precocious young poet and former student of Tagore. What follows is a charming; tentative flirtation that soon; against all the proprieties and precepts of Indian society; blossoms into a love affair both impossible and ultimately tragic. This erotic passion plays itself out in Alain's thoughts long after its bitter conclusion. In hindsight he sets down the story; quoting from the diaries of his disordered days; and trying to make sense of the sad affair. A vibrantly poetic love story; Bengal Nights is also a cruel account of the wreckage left in the wake of a young man's self discovery. At once horrifying and deeply moving; Eliade's story repeats the patterns of European engagement with India even as it exposes and condemns them. Invaluable for the insight it offers into Eliade's life and thought; it is a work of great intellectual and emotional power. ""Bengal Nights is forceful and harshly poignant; written with a great love of India informed by clear-eyed understanding. But do not open it if you prefer to remain unmoved by your reading matter.It is enough to make stones weep."" â€Literary ReviewMircea Eliade (1907-1986) was the Sewell L. Avery Distinguished Service Professor in the Divinity School and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. Many of his scholarly works; as well as his two-volume autobiography and four-volume journal; are published by the University of Chicago Press. Translated into French in 1950; Bengal Nights was an immediate critical success.

Port Royal; Jamaicaâ€²s capital; a cut-throat town of taverns; grog shops; and bawdy houses; is devoid of Londonâ€²s luxuries; life here can end swiftly with dysentery or a dagger in your back. But for Captain Charles Hunter it is a life that can also lead to riches; if he abides by the islandâ€²s code. In the name of His Majesty King Charles II of England; gold in Spanish hands is gold for the taking. And law in the New World is made by those who take it into their hands.Word in port is that the Spanish treasure galleon El Trinidad; fresh from New Spain; is stalled in nearby Matanceros harbor awaiting repairs.

With the governorâ€²s backing; Hunter assembles a roughneck crew to infiltrate the enemy island and commandeer the galleon; along with its fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloody legends of Matanceros suggest; and Hunter will lose more than one man before he finds himself on the islandâ€²s shores; where dense jungle and the firepower of Spanish infantry are all that stand between him and the treasure.With the help of his cunning crew; Hunter hijacks El Trinidad and escapes the deadly clutches of Cazalla; leaving plenty of carnage in his wake.

9780553384150,Flags of Our Fathers,"In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history; James Bradley has captured the glory; the triumph; the heartbreak; and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Here is the true story behind the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will of America.In February 1945; American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jimaâ€”and into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches strewn with comrades; they battled to the island's highest peak. And after climbing through a landscape of hell itself; they raised a flag.Now the son of one of the flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came together in a moment that will live forever.To his family; John Bradley never spoke of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy; his family discovered closed boxes of letters and photos. In Flags of Our Fathers; James Bradley draws on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company. Following these men's paths to Iwo Jima; James Bradley has written a classic story of the heroic battle for the Pacific's most crucial islandâ€”an island riddled with Japanese tunnels and 22;000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man.But perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory. The men in the photoâ€”three were killed during the battleâ€”were proclaimed heroes and flown home; to become reluctant symbols. For two of them; the adulation was shattering. Only James Bradley's father truly survived; displaying no copy of the famous photograph in his home; telling his son only: ""The real heroes of Iwo Jima were the guys who didn't come back.""Few books ever have captured the complexity and furor of war and its aftermath as well as Flags of Our Fathers. A penetrating; epic look at a generation at war; this is history told with keen insight; enormous honesty; and the passion of a son paying homage to his father. It is the story of the difference between truth and myth; the meaning of being a hero; and the essence of the human experience of war.From the Hardcover edition.",English,UK,382,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386923564l/10058.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2010-05-05,James D.

It was here that he first proclaimed the death of God -- to which a large part of the book is devoted -- and his doctrine of the eternal recurrence.Walter Kaufmann's commentary; with its many quotations from previously untranslated letters; brings to life Nietzsche as a human being and illuminates his philosophy. The book contains some of Nietzsche's most sustained discussions of art and morality; knowledge and truth; the intellectual conscience and the origin of logic.Most of the book was written just before Thus Spoke Zarathustra; the last part five years later; after Beyond Good and Evil. We encounter Zarathustra in these pages as well as many of Nietzsche's most interesting philosophical ideas and the largest collection of his own poetry that he himself ever published.Walter Kaufmann's English versions of Nietzsche represent one of the major translation enterprises of our time. He is the first philosopher to have translated Nietzsche's major works; and never before has a single translator given us so much of Nietzsche.",English,USA,398,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1374735026l/94578.jpg,Random House,2012-08-09,Friedrich Nietzsche|Walter Kaufmann,Philosophy|Nonfiction|Classics|European Literature|German Literature

9780007271210,Azincourt,Agincourt is one of the epic battles of history. It was fought by two badly matched armies that met in atrocious conditions on St Crispin's Day 1415; and resulted in an extraordinary victory that was celebrated in England long before Shakespeare immortalised it in Henry V. It has always been held to be the triumph of the longbow against the armoured knight; and of the common man against the feudal aristocrat; but those are history's myths. Bernard Cornwell; who has long wanted to write this story; depicts the reality behind the myths.Nicholas Hook is an English archer. He seems born to trouble and; when his lord orders him to London as part of a force sent to quell an expected Lollard uprising; Nick's headstrong behaviour leads to him being proscribed an outlaw. He finds refuge across the Channel; part of an English mercenary force protecting the town of Soissons against the French. What happened at the Siege of Soissons shocked all Europe; and propels Nick back to England where he is enrolled in the archer companyof the doughty Sir John Cornwaille; a leader of Henry V's army. The army was superb; but sickness and the unexpected French defiance at Harfleur; reduce it to near-shambolic condition. Henry stubbornly refuses to accept defeat and; in appalling weather; leads his shrunken force to what appears to be inevitable disaster.Azincourt culminates in the battle. Seen from several points of view on the English side; but also from the French ranks; the scene is vivid; convincing and compelling. Bernard Cornwell has a great understanding of men at war and battlefields and this is his masterpiece. This is what it must have been like to fight at Agincourt.,English,USA,453,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327151016l/3276012.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Bernard Cornwell,Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Historical|Medieval

9780141439880,Cranford,'It is very pleasant dining with a bachelor...I only hope it is not improper; so many pleasant things are!'A portrait of the residents of an English country town in the mid nineteenth century; Cranford relates the adventures of Miss Matty and Miss Deborah; two middle-aged spinster sisters striving to live with dignity in reduced circumstances. Through a series of vignettes; Elizabeth Gaskell portrays a community governed by old-fashioned habits and dominated by friendships between women. Her wry account of rural life is undercut; however; by tragedy in its depiction of such troubling events as Matty's bankruptcy; the violent death of Captain Brown or the unwitting cruelty of Peter Jenkyns. Written with acute observation; Cranford is by turns affectionate; moving and darkly satirical.In her introduction; Patricia Ingham discusses Cranford in relation to Gaskell's own past and as a work of irony in the manner of Jane Austen. She also considers the implications of the novel in terms of class and empire.

Bataille has been called a ""metaphysician of evil;"" specializing in blasphemy; profanation; and horror.Story of the Eye; written in 1928; is his best-known work; it is unashamedly surrealistic; both disgusting and fascinating; and packed with seemingly endless violations. It's something of an underground classic; rediscovered by each new generation. Most recently; the Icelandic pop singer BjÃ¶rk GuÃ°dmundsdÃ³ttir cites Story of the Eye as a major inspiration: she made a music video that alludes to Bataille's erotic uses of eggs; and she plans to read an excerpt for an album.Warning: Story of the Eye is graphically sexual; and is only for adults who are not easily offended.",English,UK,103,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1490682356l/436806.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Georges Bataille|Joachim Neugroschel|Dovid Bergelson,Fiction|Adult Fiction|Erotica|Cultural|France|Classics|Horror|Literature

9780140435720,Ethics,A profoundly beautiful and uniquely insightful description of the universe; Benedict de Spinoza's Ethics is one of the masterpieces of Enlightenment-era philosophy. This Penguin Classics edition is edited and translated from the Latin by Edwin Curley; with an introduction by Stuart Hampshire.Published shortly after his death; the Ethics is undoubtedly Spinoza's greatest work - an elegant; fully cohesive cosmology derived from first principles; providing a coherent picture of reality; and a guide to the meaning of an ethical life. Following a logical step-by-step format; it defines in turn the nature of God; the mind; the emotions; human bondage to the emotions; and the power of understanding - moving from a consideration of the eternal; to speculate upon humanity's place in the natural order; the nature of freedom and the path to attainable happiness. A powerful work of elegant simplicity; the Ethics is a brilliantly insightful consideration of the possibility of redemption through intense thought and philosophical reflection.The Ethics is presented in the standard translation of the work by Edwin Curley. This edition also includes an introduction by Stuart Hampshire; outlining Spinoza's philosophy and placing it in context.Baruch Spinoza (1632-77); later known as Benedict de Spinoza; was born in Amsterdam; where his orthodox Jewish family had fled from persecution in Portugal. Ethics was published in 1677 after his death; and his influence spread to the nineteenth century: inspiring the Romantic poets; winning the respect of Flaubert and Matthew Arnold; and moving George Eliot; who admired him as the enemy of superstition and the hero of scientific rationalism; to begin a translation of his works.If you enjoyed Ethics; you might like Rene Descartes' Meditations and Other Metaphysical Writings; also available in Penguin Classics.'The noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers ... ethically he is supreme'Bertrand Russell,English,USA,186,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1462223700l/205218.jpg,Crossley,1988-01-01,Baruch Spinoza|Edwin M.

9780300115470,Existentialism Is a Humanism,"It was to correct common misconceptions about his thought that Sartre accepted an invitation to speak on October 29; 1945; at the Club Maintenant in Paris. The unstated objective of his lecture (""Existentialism Is a Humanism"") was to expound his philosophy as a form of ""existentialism""; a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers; though; ironically; he was about to make it accessible to a general audience.Â The published text of his lectureÂ quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity.The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartreâ€™s doctrine. Man; born into an empty; godless universe; is nothing to begin with. He creates his essenceâ€”his self; his beingâ€”through the choices he freely makes ('existence precedes essence""). Were it not for the contingency of his death; he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing; therefore; we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind.This edition of Existentialism Is a Humanism is a translation of theÂ 1996 FrenchÂ edition; which includes Arlette ElkaÃ¯m-Sartreâ€™s introduction andÂ a Q&A with Sartre about his lecture. Paired with ""Existentialism Is a Humanismâ€is another seminal Sartre text; his commentary on Camusâ€™s The Stranger.

It's a book full of stories: about a girl locked out of her home; sitting on the doorstep all night; about a religious zealot disguised as a mother who has two sets of false teeth and a revolver in the dresser; waiting for Armageddon; about growing up in an north England industrial town now changed beyond recognition; about the Universe as Cosmic Dustbin. It is the story of how a painful past that Jeanette thought she'd written over and repainted rose to haunt her; sending her on a journey into madness and out again; in search of her biological mother. Witty; acute; fierce; and celebratory; Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? is a tough-minded search for belonging; for love; identity; home; and a mother.,English,USA,230,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320512373l/11395597.jpg,Penguin,2010-05-05,Jeanette Winterson,Autobiography|Memoir|Nonfiction|Biography|Lgbt|Glbt|Queer

Here is a town; as well as a world; defined by magnificent and nearly devastating contradictions.Louis Charles (â€œLucyâ€ Lynch has spent all his sixty years in upstate Thomaston; New York; married to the same woman; Sarah; for forty of them; their son now a grown man. Like his late; beloved father; Lucy is an optimist; though heâ€™s had plenty of reasons not to beâ€”chief among them his mother; still indomitably alive. Yet it was her shrewdness; combined with that Lynch optimism; that had propelled them years ago to the right side of the tracks and created an â€œempireâ€of convenience stores about to be passed on to the next generation. Lucy and Sarah are also preparing for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Italy; where his oldest friend; a renowned painter; has exiled himself far from anything theyâ€™d known in childhood. In fact; the exact nature of their friendship is one of the many mysteries Lucy hopes to untangle in the â€œhistoryâ€heâ€™s writing of his hometown and family.

9781400047470,The Double Bind,"In Chris Bohjalian's astonishing novel; nothing is what it at first seems. Not the bucolic Vermont back roads college sophomore Laurel Estabrook likes to bike. Not the savage assault she suffers toward the end of one of her rides. And certainly not Bobbie Crocker; the elderly man with a history of mental illness whom Laurel comes to know through her work at a Burlington homeless shelter in the years subsequent to the attack.In his moments of lucidity; the gentle; likable Bobbie alludes to his earlier life as a successful photographer. Laurel finds it hard to believe that this destitute; unstable man could once have chronicled the lives of musicians and celebrities; but a box of photographs and negatives discovered among Bobbie's meager possessions after his death lends credence to his tale. How could such an accomplished man have fallen on such hard times? Becoming obsessed with uncovering Bobbie's past; Laurel studies his photographs; tracking down every lead they provide into the mystery of his life before homelessness -- including links to the rich neighborhoods of her own Long Island childhood and to the earlier world of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby; with its larger-than-life characters; elusive desires; and haunting sorrows.In a narrative of dazzling invention; literary ingenuity; and psychological complexity; Bohjalian engages issues of homelessness and mental illness by evoking the humanity that inhabits the core of both. At the same time; his tale is fast-paced and riveting -- The Double Bind combines the suspense of a thriller with the emotional depths of the most intimate drama. The breathtaking surprises of its final pages will leave readers stunned; overwhelmed by the poignancy of life's fleeting truths; as caught in Bobbie Crocker's photographs and in Laurel Estabrook's painful pursuit of Bobbie's past -- and her own. Behind The Double BindWhile Bobbie Crocker; the photographer in The Double Bind; is fictitious; the photographs that appear in the book are real. They were taken by a man named Bob ""Soupy"" Campbell; who; as Chris Bohaljian explains in his Author's Note; ""had gone from photographing luminaries from the 1950s and 1960s to winding up at a homeless shelter in northern Vermont."" Bohaljian's viewing of Campbell's work after the photographer's death provided an inspiration for The Double Bind. ""We tend to stigmatize the homeless and blame them for their plight;"" Bohjalian writes. ""We are oblivious to the fact that most had lives as serious as our own before everything fell apart. The photographs in this book are a testimony to that reality.""",English,USA,384,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348690366l/126807.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1988-01-01,Chris Bohjalian,Fiction|Mystery|Book Club|Contemporary

9780375701900,Straight Man,In this uproarious new novel; Richard Russo performs his characteristic high-wire walk between hilarity and heartbreak. Russo's protagonist is William Henry Devereaux; Jr.; the reluctant chairman of the English department of a badly underfunded college in the Pennsylvania rust belt.Â Devereaux's reluctance is partly rooted in his character--he is a born anarchist-- and partly in the fact that his department is more savagely divided than the Balkans.In the course of a single week; Devereaux will have his nose mangled by an angry colleague; imagine his wife is having an affair with his dean; wonder if a curvaceous adjunct is trying to seduce him with peach pits; and threaten to execute a goose on local television.Â Â All this while coming to terms with his philandering father; the dereliction of his youthful promise; and the ominous failure of certain vital body functions.Â In short; Straight Man is classic Russo--side-splitting and true-to-life; witty; compassionate; and impossible to put down.,English,UK,391,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430659357l/414298.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2002-01-02,Richard Russo,Fiction|Humor|Contemporary|Novels|Academic|Academia

9780393301590,Civilization and Its Discontents,It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century. It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mindâ€”the so-called structural theory; with its stress on aggression; indeed the death drive; as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books; written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world; a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man; by nature aggressive and egotistical; seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime; only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan; specific renderings of key words and phrases; and the addition of valuable notes; from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.,English,USA,127,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438544596l/357636.jpg,Random House,1970-02-01,Sigmund Freud|James Strachey|Peter Gay,Psychology|Philosophy|Nonfiction|Classics|Psychology|Psychoanalysis|Sociology

9781400041980,Pnin,One of the best-loved of Nabokovâ€™s novels; Pnin features his funniest and most heart-rending character. Professor Timofey Pnin is a haplessly disoriented Russian Ã©migrÃ© precariously employed on an American college campus in the 1950s. Pnin struggles to maintain his dignity through a series of comic and sad misunderstandings; all the while falling victim both to subtle academic conspiracies and to the manipulations of a deliberately unreliable narrator.Initially an almost grotesquely comic figure; Pnin gradually grows in stature by contrast with those who laugh at him. Whether taking the wrong train to deliver a lecture in a language he has not mastered or throwing a faculty party during which he learns he is losing his job; the gently preposterous hero of this enchanting novel evokes the readerâ€™s deepest protective instinct.Serialized in The New Yorker and published in book form in 1957; Pnin brought Nabokov both his first National Book Award nomination and hitherto unprecedented popularity.,English,USA,143,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1434737531l/30593.jpg,Harper Collins,1988-01-01,Vladimir Nabokov|David Lodge,Fiction|Classics|Cultural|Russia|Novels|Literature

The tribulation; according to Grandpa Herman; founder of Fire and Brimstone; will be an ugly time: ""He said that we'd run out of food. That big bugs would chase us around and sting us with their tails . . . He said we'd turn on the faucet in the bathroom and find only blood running out . . . He said evil multitudes would come unto us and cut off our limbs; and that we wouldn't die . . . And then he'd say; 'But you don't have to be left behind. You can go straight to Heaven with all of God's special children if you'll only open your hearts to Jesus . . .'""  Such talk of damnation weighs heavy on the mind of Ninah Huff; the 15-year-old narrator of Sheri Reynolds's second novel; The Rapture of Canaan. To distract her from sinful thoughts about her prayer partner James; Ninah puts pecan shells in her shoes and nettles in her bed. But concentrating on the Passion of Jesus cannot; in the end; deter Ninah and James from their passion for each other; and the consequences prove both tragic and transforming for the entire community.  The Rapture of Canaan is a book about miracles; and in writing it; Reynolds has performed something of a miracle herself. Although the church's beliefs and practices may seem extreme (sleeping in an open grave; mortifying the flesh with barbed wire); its members are complex and profoundly sympathetic as they wrestle with the contradictions of Fire and Brimstone's theology; the temptations of the outside world; and the frailties of the human heart.",English,USA,320,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442420479l/5180.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,Sheri Reynolds,Fiction|Religion

9780486270650,The Misanthrope,The Misanthrope or Le Misanthrope ou lâ€™Atrabilaire amoureux is a comedy of manners in five acts and in verse.It is one of the best of MoliÃ¨re's plays â€and one of the greatest of all comedies â€spotlighting the absurdities of social and literary pretension; focusing on a man who is quick to criticize the faults of others; yet remains blind to his own.This play satirizes the hypocrisies of French aristocratic society; but it also engages a more serious tone when pointing out the flaws; which all humans possess. The play differs from other farces at the time by employing dynamic characters like Alceste and CÃ©limÃ¨ne as opposed to the traditionally flat characters used by most satirists to criticize problems in society. It also differs from most of MoliÃ¨re's other works by focusing more on character development and nuances than on plot progression. The play; though not a commercial success in its time; survives as MoliÃ¨re's best-known work today. Much of its universal appeal is due to common undercurrents of misanthropy across cultural borders.,English,USA,64,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1416873266l/752994.jpg,Macmillan,2010-05-05,MoliÃ¨re,Plays|Classics|Cultural|France|Drama|Fiction|Plays|Theatre|European Literature|French Literature

And yet; despite his raw talent; he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the worldâ€™s best; his greater confusion as he starts to win. After stumbling in three Grand Slam finals; Agassi shocks the world; and himself; by capturing the 1992 Wimbledon. Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.Agassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match and every relationship. Never before has the inner game of tennis and the outer game of fame been so precisely limned. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals from several generationsâ€”Jimmy Connors; Pete Sampras; Roger Federerâ€”Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals a shattering loss of confidence. And he recounts his spectacular resurrection; a comeback climaxing with his epic run at the 1999 French Open and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.In clear; taut prose; Agassi evokes his loyal brother; his wise coach; his gentle trainer; all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf. Inspired by her quiet strength; he fights through crippling pain from a deteriorating spine to remain a dangerous opponent in the twenty-first and final year of his career. Entering his last tournament in 2006; heâ€™s hailed for completing a stunning metamorphosis; from nonconformist to elder statesman; from dropout to education advocate. And still heâ€™s not done. At a U.S. Open for the ages; he makes a courageous last stand; then delivers one of the most stirring farewells ever heard in a sporting arena.With its breakneck tempo and raw candor; Open will be read and cherished for years. A treat for ardent fans; it will also captivate readers who know nothing about tennis. Like Agassiâ€™s game; it sets a new standard for grace; style; speed; and power.,English,USA,388,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320520930l/6480781.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,Andre Agassi|J.R.

Questions such as: â€œWhy do people with autism talk so loudly and weirdly?â€â€œWhy do you line up your toy cars and blocks?â€â€œWhy donâ€™t you make eye contact when youâ€™re talking?â€and â€œWhatâ€™s the reason you jump?â€(Naokiâ€™s answer: â€œWhen Iâ€™m jumping; itâ€™s as if my feelings are going upward to the sky.â€ With disarming honesty and a generous heart; Naoki shares his unique point of view on not only autism but life itself.

9780767927570,Escape,The dramatic first-person account of life inside an ultra-fundamentalist American religious sect; and one womanâ€™s courageous flight to freedom with her eight children.When she was eighteen years old; Carolyn Jessop was coerced into an arranged marriage with a total stranger: a man thirty-two years her senior. Merril Jessop already had three wives. But arranged plural marriages were an integral part of Carolynâ€™s heritage: She was born into and raised in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS); the radical offshoot of the Mormon Church that had settled in small communities along the Arizona-Utah border. Over the next fifteen years; Carolyn had eight children and withstood her husbandâ€™s psychological abuse and the watchful eyes of his other wives who were locked in a constant battle for supremacy.Carolynâ€™s every move was dictated by her husbandâ€™s whims. He decided where she lived and how her children would be treated. He controlled the money she earned as a school teacher. He chose when they had sex; Carolyn could only refuseâ€”at her peril. For in the FLDS; a wifeâ€™s compliance with her husband determined how much status both she and her children held in the family. Carolyn was miserable for years and wanted out; but she knew that if she tried to leave and got caught; her children would be taken away from her. No woman in the country had ever escaped from the FLDS and managed to get her children out; too. But in 2003; Carolyn chose freedom over fear and fled her home with her eight children. She had $20 to her name.Escape exposes a world tantamount to a prison camp; created by religious fanatics who; in the name of God; deprive their followers the right to make choices; force women to be totally subservient to men; and brainwash children in church-run schools. Against this background; Carolyn Jessopâ€™s flight takes on an extraordinary; inspiring power. Not only did she manage a daring escape from a brutal environment; she became the first woman ever granted full custody of her children in a contested suit involving the FLDS. And in 2006; her reports to the Utah attorney general on church abuses formed a crucial part of the case that led to the arrest of their notorious leader; Warren Jeffs.,English,USA,413,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442640131l/818811.jpg,Crossley,1970-02-01,Carolyn Jessop|Laura Palmer,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography|Religion

9780449205620,Captains and the Kings,This is a great surging novel about the amassing of a colossal fortune; the political power that comes with it; and the operation of a curse laid on an Irish-American dynasty and the ruthless driving man who founded it.Joseph Francis Xavier Armagh was thirteen years old when he first saw America through a dirty porthole on the steerage deck of The Irish Queen. It was the early 1850's and he was a penniless immigrant; an orphan cast on a hostile shore to make a home for himself and his younger brother and infant sister. Some seventy years later; from his deathbed; Joseph Armagh last glimpsed his adopted land from the gleaming windows of a palatial estate. A multi-millionaire; one of the most powerful and feared men; Joseph Armagh had indeed found a home. CAPTAINS AND KINGS is the story of the price that was paid for it in the consuming; single-minded determination of a man clawing his way to the top; in the bitter-sweet bliss of the love of a beautiful woman; in the almost too-late enjoyment of extraordinary children; and in the curse which used the hand of fate to strike in the very face of success itself.Once again; Taylor Caldwell has looked into America's roistering past as a setting for a drama of the consequences of savage ambition - and its meaning then and now.,English,USA,816,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388511625l/369110.jpg,Random House,1988-01-01,Taylor Caldwell,Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction|Historical|Romance

9780060512190,The Beauty Myth,"The bestselling classic that redefined our view of the relationship between beauty and female identity. In today's world; women have more power; legal recognition; and professional success than ever before. Alongside the evident progress of the women's movement; however; writer and journalist Naomi Wolf is troubled by a different kind of social control; which; she argues; may prove just as restrictive as the traditional image of homemaker and wife. It's the beauty myth; an obsession with physical perfection that traps the modern woman in an endless spiral of hope; self-consciousness; and self-hatred as she tries to fulfill society's impossible definition of ""the flawless beauty.""",English,USA,368,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388197585l/39926.jpg,Macmillan,2010-05-05,Naomi Wolf,Feminism|Nonfiction|Sociology|Psychology
9780141183720,Keep the Aspidistra Flying,"London; 1936. Gordon Comstock has declared war on the money god; and Gordon is losing the war. Nearly 30 and ""rather moth-eaten already;"" a poet whose one small book of verse has fallen ""flatter than any pancake;"" Gordon has given up a ""good"" job and gone to work in a bookshop at half his former salary. Always broke; but too proud to accept charity; he rarely sees his few friends and cannot get the virginal Rosemary to bed because (or so he believes); ""If you have no money ... women won't love you."" On the windowsill of Gordon's shabby rooming-house room is a sickly but unkillable aspidistra--a plant he abhors as the banner of the sort of ""mingy; lower-middle-class decency"" he is fleeing in his downward flight.In Keep the Aspidistra Flying; George Orwell has created a darkly compassionate satire to which anyone who has ever been oppressed by the lack of brass; or by the need to make it; will all too easily relate. He etches the ugly insanity of what Gordon calls ""the money-world"" in unflinching detail; but the satire has a second edge; too; and Gordon himself is scarcely heroic. In the course of his misadventures; we become grindingly aware that his radical solution to the problem of the money-world is no solution at all--that in his desperate reaction against a monstrous system; he has become something of a monster himself. Orwell keeps both of his edges sharp to the very end--a ""happy"" ending that poses tough questions about just how happy it really is. That the book itself is not sour; but constantly fresh and frequently funny; is the result of Orwell's steady; unsentimental attention to the telling detail; his dry; quiet humor; his fascination with both the follies and the excellences of his characters; and his courageous refusal to embrace the comforts of any easy answer.",English,USA,277,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1331244097l/9648.jpg,Hachette,1988-01-01,George Orwell,Fiction|Classics|European Literature|British Literature|Literature

9780691024170,QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter,"Famous the world over for the creative brilliance of his insights into the physical world; Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman also possessed an extraordinary talent for explaining difficult concepts to the nonscientist. QED--the edited version of four lectures on quantum electrodynamics that Feynman gave to the general public at UCLA as part of the Alix G. Mautner Memorial Lecture series--is perhaps the best example of his ability to communicate both the substance and the spirit of science to the layperson.The focus; as the title suggests; is quantum electrodynamics (QED); the part of the quantum theory of fields that describes the interactions of the quanta of the electromagnetic field-light; X rays; gamma rays--with matter and those of charged particles with one another. By extending the formalism developed by Dirac in 1933; which related quantum and classical descriptions of the motion of particles; Feynman revolutionized the quantum mechanical understanding of the nature of particles and waves. And; by incorporating his own readily visualizable formulation of quantum mechanics; Feynman created a diagrammatic version of QED that made calculations much simpler and also provided visual insights into the mechanisms of quantum electrodynamic processes. In this book; using everyday language; spatial concepts; visualizations; and his renowned ""Feynman diagrams"" instead of advanced mathematics; Feynman successfully provides a definitive introduction to QED for a lay readership without any distortion of the basic science. Characterized by Feynman's famously original clarity and humor; this popular book on QED has not been equaled since its publication.",English,UK,158,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386920718l/5552.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Richard Feynman,Science|Science|Physics|Nonfiction|Science|Popular Science
9780307266770,The Museum of Innocence,â€œIt was the happiest moment of my life; though I didnâ€™t know it.â€So begins the new novel; his first since winning the Nobel Prize; from the universally acclaimed author of Snow and My Name Is Red. It is 1975; a perfect spring in Istanbul. Kemal; scion of one of the cityâ€™s wealthiest families; is about to become engaged to Sibel; daughter of another prominent family; when he encounters FÃ¼sun; a beautiful shopgirl and a distant relation. Once the long-lost cousins violate the code of virginity; a rift begins to open between Kemal and the world of the Westernized Istanbul bourgeosieâ€”a world; as he lovingly describes it; with opulent parties and clubs; society gossip; restaurant rituals; picnics; and mansions on the Bosphorus; infused with the melancholy of decayâ€”until finally he breaks off his engagement to Sibel. But his resolve comes too late. For eight years Kemal will find excuses to visit another Istanbul; that of the impoverished backstreets where FÃ¼sun; her heart now hardened; lives with her parents; and where Kemal discovers the consolations of middle-class life at a dinner table in front of the television. His obsessive love will also take him to the demimonde of Istanbul film circles (where he promises to make FÃ¼sun a star); a scene of seedy bars; run-down cheap hotels; and small men with big dreams doomed to bitter failure. In his feckless pursuit; Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of objects that chronicle his lovelorn progress and his afflicted heartâ€™s reactions: anger and impatience; remorse and humiliation; deluded hopes of recovery; and daydreams that transform Istanbul into a cityscape of signs and specters of his beloved; from whom now he can extract only meaningful glances and stolen kisses in cars; movie houses; and shadowy corners of parks. A last change to realize his dream will come to an awful end before Kemal discovers that all he finally can possess; certainly and eternally; is the museum he has created of his collection; this map of a societyâ€™s manners and mores; and of one manâ€™s broken heart.A stirring exploration of the nature of romantic attachment and of the mysterious allure of collecting; The Museum of Innocence also plumbs the depths of an Istanbul half Western and half traditionalâ€”its emergent modernity; its vast cultural history.

9780307269200,What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,"In 1982; having sold his jazz bar to devote himself to writing; Murakami began running to keep fit. A year later; he'd completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon; and now; after dozens of such races; not to mention triathlons and a dozen critically acclaimed books; he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and--even more important--on his writing. Equal parts training log; travelogue; and reminiscence; this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and takes us to places ranging from Tokyo's Jingu Gaien gardens; where he once shared the course with an Olympian; to the Charles River in Boston among young women who outpace him.

Trilogy; Stand on Zanzibar is a cross-section of a world overpopulated by the billions. Where society is squeezed into hive-living madness by god-like mega computers; mass-marketed psychedelic drugs; and mundane uses of genetic engineering. Though written in 1968; it speaks of 2010; and is frighteningly prescient and intensely powerful.This edition comes with a tipped in collectors' note and an introduction by David Brin.,English,UK,672,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360613921l/41069.jpg,Penguin,2002-01-02,John Brunner,Science Fiction|Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia

9780375758120,The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,Length: 126 hrs and 31 minsThe History of the Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire was written by English historian Edward Gibbon & originally published in six quarto volumes. Volume 1 was published in 1776; going thru six printings; 2-3 in 1781; 4-6 in 1788-89. It was a major literary achievement of the 18th century; adopted as a model for the methodologies of historians.The books cover the Roman Empire after Marcus Aurelius; from 180 to 1590. They take as their material the behavior & decisions that led to the eventual fall of the Empire in East & West; offering explanations.Gibbon is called the 1st modern historian of ancient Rome. By virtue of its mostly objective approach & accurate use of reference material; his work was adopted as a model for the methodologies of 19-20th century historians. His pessimism & detached irony was common to the historical genre of his era. Although he published other books; Gibbon devoted much of his life (1772-89) to this one work. His Memoirs of My Life & Writings is devoted largely to his reflections on how the book virtually became his life. He compared the publication of each succeeding volume to a newborn.Gibbon offers an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell; a task difficult because of few comprehensive written sources; tho he wasn't the only historian to tackle the subject. Most of his ideas are taken from what few relevant records were available: those of Roman moralists of the 4-5th centuries. According to Gibbon; the Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions because of lost of civic virtue. They'd become weak; outsourcing defence to barbarian mercenaries; who became so numerous & ingrained that they took over. Romans had become effeminate; incapable of tough military lifestyles. In addition; Christianity created belief that a better life existed after death; fostering indifference to the present; sapping patriotism. Its comparative pacifism tended to hamper martial spirit. Lastly; like other Enlightenment thinkers; he held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden; superstitious; dark age. It wasn't until his age of reason that history could progress.,English,USA,1312,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435759367l/19400.jpg,Macmillan,1970-02-01,Edward Gibbon|Daniel J.

When Caesar; a recent arrival from Virginia; tells her about the Underground Railroad; they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influencesâ€”biographical; historical; and literaryâ€”to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.Virtually unknown during his lifetime; Franz Kafka is now one of the worldâ€™s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern manâ€™s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre; hostile; and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafkaâ€™s masterpiece; â€œThe Metamorphosis;â€a story that is both harrowing and amusing; and a landmark of modern literature. Bringing together some of Kafkaâ€™s finest work; this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the authorâ€™s artistry. â€œThe Judgment;â€which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough; and â€œThe Stoker;â€which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika; are here included. These two; along with â€œThe Metamorphosis;â€form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as â€œThe Sons;â€and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.Also included are â€œIn the Penal Colony;â€a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims; and â€œA Hunger Artist;â€about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public.

9781594202840,Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,"An awe-inspiring; often hilarious; and unerringly honest story of one mother's exercise in extreme parenting; revealing the rewardsâ€”and the costsâ€”of raising her children the Chinese way.""This is a story about a mother; two daughters; and two dogs. This was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones. But instead; it's about a bitter clash of cultures; a fleeting taste of glory; and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old."" â€”Amy ChuaAll decent parents want to do what's best for their children. What Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother reveals is that the Chinese just have a totally different idea of how to do that. Western parents try to respect their children's individuality; encouraging them to pursue their true passions and providing a nurturing environment. The Chinese believe that the best way to protect your children is by preparing them for the future and arming them with skills; strong work habits; and inner confidence. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother chronicles Chua's iron-willed decision to raise her daughters; Sophia and Lulu; her wayâ€”the Chinese wayâ€”and the remarkable results her choice inspires.Here are some things Amy Chua would never allow her daughters to do:- have a playdate- be in a school play- complain about not being in a school play- not be the #1 student in every subject except gym and drama- play any instrument other than the piano or violin- not play the piano or violinThe truth is Lulu and Sophia would never have had time for a playdate. They were too busy practicing their instruments (two to three hours a day and double sessions on the weekend) and perfecting their Mandarin.Of course no one is perfect; including Chua herself. Witness this scene:""According to Sophia; here are three things I actually said to her at the piano as I supervised her practicing:- Oh my God; you're just getting worse and worse.- I'm going to count to three; then I want musicality.- If the next time's not PERFECT; I'm going to take all your stuffed animals and burn them!""But Chua demands as much of herself as she does of her daughters. And in her sacrificesâ€”the exacting attention spent studying her daughters' performances; the office hours lost shuttling the girls to lessonsâ€”the depth of her love for her children becomes clear. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is an eye-opening exploration of the differences in Eastern and Western parentingâ€”and the lessons parents and children everywhere teach one another.",English,USA,237,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347794294l/9160695.jpg,Macmillan,2010-05-05,Amy Chua,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Parenting|Biography

9780307277750,Marie Antoinette: The Journey,Brilliantly written; a work of impeccable scholarship. An utterly riveting and intensely moving book by one of our finest biographers.Never before has the life of Marie Antoinette been told so intimately and with such authority as in Antonia Fraser's newest work; Marie Antoinette: The Journey. Famously known as the eighteenth-century French queen whose excesses have become legend; Marie Antoinette was blamed for instigating the French Revolution. But the story of her journey begun as a fourteen-year-old sent from Vienna to marry the future Louis XVI to her courageous defense before she was sent to the guillotine reveals a woman of greater complexity and character than we have previously understood. We stand beside Marie Antoinette and witness the drama of her life as she becomes a scapegoat of the Ancien Regime when her faults were minor in comparison to the punishments inflicted on her.The youngest daughter; fifteenth out of sixteen children; of Austrian empress Maria Teresa and Francis I; Marie Antoinette was sent on a literal journey by her mother from Vienna to Versailles with the expectation that she would further Austrian interests at all times. Yet; Marie Antoinette was by nature far from interested in state affairs and much more inclined to exert a gracious; philanthropic role; patronizing the arts especially music; as royalty would come to behave in the nineteenth century. Despite this the French accused her of political interference and wrote scandalous tracts against her; mocking her lack of sophistication. Meanwhile; longing for a family and the birth of an heir who would have cemented the Franco-Austro alliance; the French queen had to endure more than eight years of public humiliation for her barren marriage before the delivery of her first of four children.As these problems unfold; Antonia Fraser also weaves a richly detailed account of Marie Antoinette's other; more poignant journey: from the ill-educated and unprepared girl who sought refuge in pleasure as a consolation into a magnificent; courageous woman who defied her enemies at her trial with consummate intelligence; arousing the admiration of even the most hostile revolutionaries.Brilliantly written; Marie Antoinette is a work of impeccable scholarship. Drawing on a wealth of family letters and other archival materials; Antonia Fraser successfully avoids the hagiography of some the French queen's admirers and the misogyny of many of her critics. The result is an utterly riveting and intensely moving book by one of our finest biographers.,English,USA,512,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388200308l/17157.jpg,Random House,2002-01-02,Antonia Fraser,History|Biography|Nonfiction|Cultural|France

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parentsâ€indiscretion; Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life; bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could; at any moment; steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africaâ€™s tyrannical white rule; Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure; living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young manâ€™s relationship with his fearless; rebellious; and fervently religious motherâ€”his teammate; a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty; violence; and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.The eighteen personal essays collected here are by turns hilarious; dramatic; and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times; being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping; or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school; Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time; armed only with a keen sense of humor and a motherâ€™s unconventional; unconditional love.Source: penguinrandomhouse.ca,English,USA,304,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1473867911l/29780253.jpg,Hachette,2002-01-02,Trevor Noah,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography|Audiobook

9780425192730,Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed,Now updated with new material that brings the killer's picture into clearer focus.In the fall of 1888; all of London was held in the grip of unspeakable terror.Â  An elusive madman calling himself Jack the Ripper was brutally butchering women in the slums of Londonâ€™s East End.Â  Police seemed powerless to stop the killer; who delighted in taunting them and whose crimes were clearly escalating in violence from victim to victim.Â  And then the Ripperâ€™s violent spree seemingly ended as abruptly as it had begun.Â  He had struck out of nowhere and then vanished from the scene.Â  Decades passed; then fifty years; then a hundred; and the Ripperâ€™s bloody sexual crimes became anemic and impotent fodder for puzzles; mystery weekends; crime conventions; and so-called â€œRipper Walksâ€that end with pints of ale in the pubs of Whitechapel.Â  But to number-one New York Times bestselling novelist Patricia Cornwell; the Ripper murders are not cute little mysteries to be transformed into parlor games or movies but rather a series of terrible crimes that no one should get away with; even after death.Â  Now Cornwell applies her trademark skills for meticulous research and scientific expertise to dig deeper into the Ripper case than any detective before herâ€”and reveal the true identity of this fabled Victorian killer.In Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper; Case Closed; Cornwell combines the rigorous discipline of twenty-first century police investigation with forensic techniques undreamed of during the late Victorian era to solve one of the most infamous and difficult serial murder cases in history.Â  Drawing on unparalleled access to original Ripper evidence; documents; and records; as well as archival; academic; and law-enforcement resources; FBI profilers; and top forensic scientists; Cornwell reveals that Jack the Ripper was none other than a respected painter of his day; an artist now collected by some of the worldâ€™s finest museums: Walter Richard Sickert.It has been said of Cornwell that no one depicts the human capability for evil better than she.Â  Â Adding layer after layer of circumstantial evidence to the physical evidence discovered by modern forensic science and expert minds; Cornwell shows that Sickert; who died peacefully in his bed in 1942; at the age of 81; was not only one of Great Britainâ€™s greatest painters but also a serial killer; a damaged diabolical man driven by megalomania and hate.Â  She exposes Sickert as the author of the infamous Ripper letters that were written to the Metropolitan Police and the press.Â  Her detailed analysis of his paintings shows that his art continually depicted his horrific mutilation of his victims; and her examination of this manâ€™s birth defects; the consequent genital surgical interventions; and their effects on his upbringing present a casebook example of how a psychopathic killer is created.New information and startling revelations detailed in Portrait of a Killer include:- How a year-long battery of more than 100 DNA testsâ€”on samples drawn by Cornwellâ€™s forensics team in September 2001 from original Ripper letters and Sickert documentsâ€”yielded the first shadows of the 75- to 114 year-old genetic evid...,English,USA,383,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388307107l/6538.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Patricia Cornwell,Nonfiction|Crime|True Crime|History|Mystery|Crime|Mystery

By the time the inevitable confrontation with Rudzak occurs; Logan will be forced to risk both his life and his heart in hopes of keeping Sarah and Monty safe. And Sarah must risk everything she holds dear if she ever hopes to find a happiness she is only now beginning to realize. Fans of Johansen's previous books in this series; The Face of Deception and The Killing Game; will enjoy brief though hair-raising appearances by Eve; Joe Quinn; and Jane -- the spunky; street-wise child Eve adopted in the last book. Also filling out the character roster is an intriguing love interest for Monty: an injured gray wolf named Maggie. But the best parts of Johansen's latest effort are her characteristically explosive mix of chilling terror and heated passion and her gift for weaving a tale of intrigue where seeing isn't necessarily believing.

9780743260050,Assassination Vacation,Sarah Vowell exposes the glorious conundrums of American history and culture with wit; probity; and an irreverent sense of humor. With Assassination Vacation; she takes us on a road trip like no otherâ€”a journey to the pit stops of American political murder and through the myriad ways they have been used for fun and profit; for political and cultural advantage.From Buffalo to Alaska; Washington to the Dry Tortugas; Vowell visits locations immortalized and influenced by the spilling of politically important blood; reporting as she goes with her trademark blend of wisecracking humor; remarkable honesty; and thought-provoking criticism. We learn about the jinx that was Robert Todd Lincoln (present at the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln; Garfield; and McKinley) and witness the politicking that went into the making of the Lincoln Memorial. The resulting narrative is much more than an entertaining and informative travelogueâ€”it is the disturbing and fascinating story of how American death has been manipulated by popular culture; including literature; architecture; sculpture; andâ€”the author's favoriteâ€historical tourism. Though the themes of loss and violence are explored and we make detours to see how the Republican Party became the Republican Party; there are all kinds of lighter diversions along the way into the lives of the three presidents and their assassins; including mummies; show tunes; mean-spirited totem poles; and a nineteenth-century biblical sex cult.,English,USA,258,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440616283l/3110.jpg,Macmillan,2010-05-05,Sarah Vowell,Nonfiction|History|Humor|Travel|Writing|Essays
9780802715360,The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher: A Shocking Murder and the Undoing of a Great Victorian Detective,The dramatic story of the real-life murder that inspired the birth of modern detective fiction. In June of 1860 three-year-old Saville Kent was found at the bottom of an outdoor privy with his throat slit. The crime horrified all England and led to a national obsession with detection; ironically destroying; in the process; the career of perhaps the greatest detective in the land.At the time; the detective was a relatively new invention; there were only eight detectives in all of England and rarely were they called out of London; but this crime was so shocking; as Kate Summerscale relates in her scintillating new book; that Scotland Yard sent its best man to investigate; Inspector Jonathan Whicher. Whicher quickly believed the unbelievableâ€”that someone within the family was responsible for the murder of young Saville Kent. Without sufficient evidence or a confession; though; his case was circumstantial and he returned to London a broken man. Though he would be vindicated five years later; the real legacy of Jonathan Whicher lives on in fiction: the tough; quirky; knowing; and all-seeing detective that we know and love todayâ€¦from the cryptic Sgt. Cuff in Wilkie Collinsâ€™s The Moonstone to Dashiell Hammettâ€™s Sam Spade. The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher is a provocative work of nonfiction that reads like a Victorian thriller; and in it Kate Summerscale has fashioned a brilliant; multilayered narrative that is as cleverly constructed as it is beautifully written.,English,USA,360,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312021413l/1747896.jpg,Penguin,1988-01-01,Kate Summerscale,Nonfiction|History|Crime|True Crime|Mystery|Mystery|Crime|Historical

9781594488850,Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate peopleâ€”at work; at school; at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others) explains in his paradigm-shattering book Drive; the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives; to learn and create new things; and to do better by ourselves and our world.Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation; Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business doesâ€”and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century; it's precisely the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In Drive; he reveals the three elements of true motivation:*Autonomyâ€”the desire to direct our own lives*Masteryâ€”the urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purposeâ€”the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselvesAlong the way; he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.Drive is bursting with big ideasâ€”the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live.,English,USA,242,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348931599l/6452796.jpg,Crossley,1970-02-01,Daniel H.

9780674430010,Capital in the Twenty-First Century,"What are the grand dynamics that drive the accumulation and distribution of capital? Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality; the concentration of wealth; and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy. But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for lack of adequate data and clear guiding theories. In Capital in the Twenty-First Century; ""Thomas Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries; ranging as far back as the eighteenth century; to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality.Piketty shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II. The main driver of inequality--the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth--today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values. But economic trends are not acts of God. Political action has curbed dangerous inequalities in the past; Piketty says; and may do so again.A work of extraordinary ambition; originality; and rigor; Capital in the Twenty-First Century ""reorients our understanding of economic history and confronts us with sobering lessons for today.",English,UK,685,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390111547l/18736925.jpg,Crossley,1970-02-01,Thomas Piketty|Arthur Goldhammer,Economics|Nonfiction|History|Politics|Business|Economics|Finance

It's the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from; the book you gave your sister when she got married. This; the first revision in more than twenty years; is better than ever. Here's why: Every chapter has been rethought with an emphasis on freshness; convenience; and health.All the recipes have been reconceived and tested with an eye to modern taste; and the cooking knowledge imparted with each subject enriched to the point where everyone from a beginning to an experienced cook will feel completely supported.The new Joy continues the vision of American cooking that began with the first edition of Joy. It is still the book you can turn to for perfect Beef Wellington and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. It's also the book where you can now find Turkey on the Grill; Spicy Peanut Sesame Noodles; and vegetarian meals.The new Joy provides more thorough descriptions of ingredients; from the familiar to the most exotic. For instance; almost all the varieties of apples grown domestically are described-- the months they become available; how they taste; what they are best used for; and how long they keep. But for the first time Joy features a complete section on fresh and dried chili peppers: how to roast and grill them; how to store them; and how long they keep-- with illustrations of each pepper.An all-new ""RULES"" section in many chapters gives essential cooking basics at a glance: washing and storing salad greens; selecting a pasta and a matching sauce; determining when a piece of fish is cooked through; stuffing a chicken; and making a perfect souffle.New chapters reflect changing American tastes and lifestyles:Separate new chapters on grains; beans; and pasta include recipes for grits; polenta; pilafs; risottos; vegetarian chills; bean casseroles; and make-ahead lasagnes.New baking and dessert chapters promise to enhance Joy of Cooking's reputation as a bible for bakers. Quick and yeast bread recipes range from focaccia; pizza; and sourdoughs to muffins and coffee cakes. Separate chapters cover custards and puddings; pies and tarts; cookies; cakes; cobblers; and other American fruit desserts revived for this edition. Recipes include one-bowl cakes; gingerbread; angel and sponge cakes; meringues; pound cakes; fruitcakes; 6 different kinds of cheesecake-- there's even an illustrated wedding cake recipe; which takes you through all the stages from building a stand; making and decorating the cake; to transporting it to the reception without a hitch.Little Dishes showcases foods from around the world: hummus; baba ghanoush; bruschetta; tacos; empanadas; and fried wontons.AII new drawings of techniques; ingredients; and equipment; integrated throughout an elegant new design; and over 300 more pages round out the new Joy.Among this book's other unique features: microwave instructions for preparing beans; grains; and vegetables; dozens of new recipes for people who are lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten; expanded ingredients chart now features calories; essential vitamins; and levels of fats and cholesterol. There are ideas for substitutions to lower fat in recipes and reduced-fat recipes in the baking sections.From cover to cover; Joy's chapters have been imbued with the knowledge and passion of America's greatest cooks and cooking teachers.

9780061240270,Belong to Me,Everyone has secrets. Some we keep to protect ourselves; others we keep to protect those we love.A devoted city dweller; Cornelia Brown surprised no one more than herself when she was gripped by the sudden; inescapable desire to leave urban life behind and head for an idyllic suburb. Though she knows she and her beloved husband; Teo; have made the right move; she approaches her new life with trepidation and struggles to forge friendships in her new home. Cornelia's mettle is quickly tested by judgmental neighbor Piper Truitt. Perfectly manicured; impeccably dressed; and possessing impossible standards; Piper is the embodiment of everything Cornelia feared she would find in suburbia. A saving grace soon appears in the form of Lake. Over a shared love of literature and old movies; Cornelia develops an instant bond with this warm yet elusive woman who has also recently arrived in town; ostensibly to send her perceptive and brilliant son; Dev; to a school for the gifted.Marisa de los Santos's literary talents shine in the complex interactions she creates between these three women. She deftly explores the life-altering roller coaster of emotions Piper faces as she cares for two households; her own and that of her cancer-stricken best friend; Elizabeth. Skillfully; de los Santos creates an enigmatic and beguiling character in Lake; who draws Cornelia closer even as she harbors a shocking secret. And from the first page until the exhilarating conclusion; de los Santos engages readers with Cornelia; who; while trying to adapt to her new surroundings; must remain true to herself. As their individual stories unfold; the women become entangled in a web of trust; betrayal; love; and loss that challenges them in ways they never imagined; and that ultimately teaches them what it means for one human being to belong to another.,English,USA,400,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441939798l/2113410.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Marisa de los Santos,Contemporary|Fiction|Adult|Adult Fiction

9780099481250,Enduring Love,"Joe planned a postcard-perfect afternoon in the English countryside to celebrate his lover's return after 6 weeks in the States. The perfect day turns to nightmare; however; when they are involved in freak ballooning accident in which a boy is saved but a man is killed. In itself; the accident would change the couple and the survivors' lives; filling them with an uneasy combination of shame; happiness; and endless self-reproach. But fate has far more unpleasant things in store for Joe. Meeting the eye of fellow rescuer Jed Parry; for example; turns out to be a very bad move. For Jed is instantly obsessed; making the first of many calls to Joe and Clarissa's London flat that very night. Soon he's openly shadowing Joe and writing him endless letters. (One insane epistle begins; ""I feel happiness running through me like an electrical current. I close my eyes and see you as you were last night in the rain; across the road from me; with the unspoken love between us as strong as steel cable."") Worst of all; Jed's version of love comes to seem a distortion of Joe's feelings for Clarissa.  Apart from the incessant stalking; it is the conditionals--the contingencies--that most frustrate Joe; a scientific journalist. If only he and Clarissa had gone straight home from the airport... If only the wind hadn't picked up... If only he had saved Jed's 29 messages in a single day... Ian McEwan has long been a poet of the arbitrary nightmare; his characters ineluctably swept up in others' fantasies; skidding into deepening violence; and--worst of all--becoming strangers to those who love them. Even his prose itself is a masterful and methodical exercise in de-familiarisation. But Enduring Love and its underrated predecessor; Black Dogs; are also meditations on knowledge and perception as well as brilliant manipulations of our own expectations. By the novel's end; you will be surprisingly unafraid of hot-air balloons; but you won't be too keen on looking a stranger in the eye. --Alex Freeman",English,USA,245,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1313656531l/6870.jpg,Crossley,2002-01-02,Ian McEwan,Fiction|Contemporary|European Literature|British Literature

The attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11 and the Iraq war? Or the convergence of technology and events that allowed India; China; and so many other countries to become part of the global supply chain for services and manufacturing; creating an explosion of wealth in the middle classes of the world's two biggest nations; giving them a huge new stake in the success of globalization?

9780802141320,The Wretched of the Earth,"A distinguished psychiatrist from Martinique who took part in the Algerian Nationalist Movement; Frantz Fanon was one of the most important theorists of revolutionary struggle; colonialism; and racial difference in history. Fanon s masterwork is a classic alongside Edward Said s Orientalism or The Autobiography of Malcolm X; and it is now available in a new translation that updates its language for a new generation of readers. The Wretched of the Earth is a brilliant analysis of the psychology of the colonized and their path to liberation. Bearing singular insight into the rage and frustration of colonized peoples; and the role of violence in effecting historical change; the book incisively attacks the twin perils of postindependence colonial politics: the disenfranchisement of the masses by the elites on the one hand; and intertribal and interfaith animosities on the other. Fanon s analysis; a veritable handbook of social reorganization for leaders of emerging nations; has been reflected all too clearly in the corruption and violence that has plagued present-day Africa. The Wretched of the Earth has had a major impact on civil rights; anticolonialism; and black consciousness movements around the world; and this bold new translation by Richard Philcox reaffirms it as a landmark.""",English,USA,320,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1427605420l/66933.jpg,Harper Collins,1988-01-01,Frantz Fanon|Jean-Paul Sartre|Richard Philcox|Homi K.

Part Three Cups of Tea; part Into Thin Air; Grennan's remarkable memoir is at once gripping and inspirational; and it carries us deep into an exotic world that most readers know little about.One Person Can Make a Difference In search of adventure; twenty-nine-year-old Conor Grennan traded his day job for a year-long trip around the globe; a journey that began with a three-month stint volunteering at the Little Princes Children's Home; an orphanage in war-torn Nepal. Conor was initially reluctant to volunteer; unsure whether he had the proper skill; or enough passion; to get involved in a developing country in the middle of a civil war. But he was soon overcome by the herd of rambunctious; resilient children who would challenge and reward him in a way that he had never imagined. When Conor learned the unthinkable truth about their situation; he was stunned: The children were not orphans at all. Child traffickers were promising families in remote villages to protect their children from the civil war - for a huge fee - by taking them to safety. They would then abandon the children far from home; in the chaos of Nepal's capital; Kathmandu. For Conor; what began as a footloose adventure becomes a commitment to reunite the children he had grown to love with their families; but this would be no small task. He would risk his life on a journey through the legendary mountains of Nepal; facing the dangers of a bloody civil war and a debilitating injury. Waiting for Conor back in Kathmandu; and hopeful he would make it out before being trapped in by snow; was the woman who would eventually become his wife and share his life's work. Little Princes is a true story of families and children; and what one person is capable of when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. At turns tragic; joyful; and hilarious; Little Princes is a testament to the power of faith and the ability of love to carry us beyond our wildest expectations.,English,UK,294,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1279553857l/8564644.jpg,Penguin,2010-05-05,Conor Grennan,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Travel|Biography|Cultural|Asia|Biography Memoir|Biography|Autobiography|Inspirational|Adventure|Adult

Another nameless town; another target for First Recon. It's only five in the afternoon; but a sandtorm has plunged everything into a hellish twilight of murky; red dust. On rooftops; in alleyways lurk militiamen with machine guns; AK rifles and the odd rocket-propelled grenade. Artillery bombardment has shattered the town's sewers and rubble is piled up in lagoons of human excrement. It stinks. Welcome to Iraq...
Within hours of 9/11; America's war on terrorism fell to those like the 23 Marines of the First Recon Battalion; the first generation dispatched into open-ed combat since Vietnam. They were a new breed of American warrior unrecognizable to their forebears-soldiers raised on hip hop; Internet porn; Marilyn Manson; video games and The Real World; a band of born-again Christians; dopers; Buddhists; and New Agers who gleaned their precepts from kung fu movies and Oprah Winfrey.

9781439171220,The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values,"Sam Harris' first book; The End of Faith; ignited a worldwide debate about the validity of religion. In the aftermath; Harris discovered that most people - from religious fundamentalists to non-believing scientists - agree on one point: science has nothing to say on the subject of human values. Indeed; our failure to address questions of meaning and morality through science has now become the most common justification for religious faith. It is also the primary reason why so many secularists and religious moderates feel obligated to ""respect"" the hardened superstitions of their more devout neighbors.In this explosive new book; Sam Harris tears down the wall between scientific facts and human values; arguing that most people are simply mistaken about the relationship between morality and the rest of human knowledge. Harris urges us to think about morality in terms of human and animal well-being; viewing the experiences of conscious creatures as peaks and valleys on a ""moral landscape."" Because there are definite facts to be known about where we fall on this landscape; Harris foresees a time when science will no longer limit itself to merely describing what people do in the name of ""morality""; in principle; science should be able to tell us what we ought to do to live the best lives possible.Bringing a fresh perspective to age-old questions of right and wrong and good and evil; Harris demonstrates that we already know enough about the human brain and its relationship to events in the world to say that there are right and wrong answers to the most pressing questions of human life. Because such answers exist; moral relativism is simply false - and comes at increasing cost to humanity. And the intrusions of religion into the sphere of human values can be finally repelled: for just as there is no such thing as Christian physics or Muslim algebra; there can be no Christian or Muslim morality.Using his expertise in philosophy and neuroscience; along with his experience on the front lines of our ""culture wars;"" Harris delivers a game-changing book about the future of science and about the real basis of human cooperation.",English,USA,291,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1331317058l/7785194.jpg,Hachette,2002-01-02,Sam Harris,Philosophy|Science|Nonfiction|Religion|Psychology|Religion|Atheism

America faced a troubling question: What happened? How was this epidemic allowed to spread so far before it was taken seriously? In answering these questions; Shilts weaves the disparate threads into a coherent story; pinning down every evasion and contradiction at the highest levels of the medical; political; and media establishments. Shilts shows that the epidemic spread wildly because the federal government put budget ahead of the nation's welfare; health authorities placed political expediency before the public health; and scientists were often more concerned with international prestige than saving lives. Against this backdrop; Shilts tells the heroic stories of individuals in science and politics; public health and the gay community; who struggled to alert the nation to the enormity of the danger it faced. And the Band Played On is both a tribute to these heroic people and a stinging indictment of the institutions that failed the nation so badly.,English,USA,656,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386924077l/28212.jpg,Harper Collins,2012-08-09,Randy Shilts|William Greider,Nonfiction|History|Lgbt|Politics|Science|Health|Medicine

9780143034760,Alexander Hamilton,"Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton; the Founding Father who galvanized; inspired; scandalized; and shaped the newborn nation.In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades; Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape; inspire; and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis; 
Alexander Hamilton
 is â€œa robust full-length portrait; in my view the best ever written; of the most brilliant; charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.â€Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernowâ€™s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight; deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of todayâ€™s America is the result of Hamiltonâ€™s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. â€œTo repudiate his legacy;â€Chernow writes; â€œis; in many ways; to repudiate the modern world.â€Chernow here recounts Hamiltonâ€™s turbulent life: an illegitimate; largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean; he came out of nowhere to take America by storm; rising to become George Washingtonâ€™s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army; coauthoring The Federalist Papers; founding the Bank of New York; leading the Federalist Party; and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of Americaâ€™s birth as the triumph of Jeffersonâ€™s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man; whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than weâ€™ve encountered beforeâ€”from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations; from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson; Madison; Adams; Monroe; and Burr; and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamiltonâ€™s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.Chernowâ€™s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton; but the story of Americaâ€™s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots; 
Alexander Hamilton
 will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.",English,UK,818,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436131915l/16130.jpg,Harper Collins,1988-01-01,Ron Chernow,History|Nonfiction|Biography|North American Hi...|American History|Politics

One went on to be a Rhodes Scholar; decorated combat veteran; White House Fellow; and business leader. The other is serving a life sentence in prison. Here is the story of two boys and the journey of a generation.Â In December 2000; the Baltimore Sun ran a small piece about Wes Moore; a local student who had just received a Rhodes Scholarship.

The police were still hunting for two of the suspects who had gone on the lam; a pair of brothers.

Over dozens of letters and prison visits; Wes discovered thatÂ the other Wes had had a life not unlike his own: Both had grown up in similar neighborhoods and had had difficult childhoods; both were fatherless; theyâ€™d hung out on similar corners with similar crews; and both had run into trouble with the police.

After all; art is rarely made by Mozart-like people; essentially-statistically speaking-there aren't any people like that.

9781594202290,Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything,"Foer's unlikely journey from chronically forgetful science journalist to U.S. Memory Champion frames a revelatory exploration of the vast; hidden impact of memory on every aspect of our lives.   On average; people squander forty days annually compensating for things they've forgotten. Joshua Foer used to be one of those people. But after a year of memory training; he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. Even more important; Foer found a vital truth we too often forget: In every way that matters; we are the sum of our memories. Moonwalking with Einstein draws on cutting-edge research; a surprising cultural history of memory; and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to transform our understanding of human remembering. Under the tutelage of top ""mental athletes;"" he learns ancient techniques once employed by Cicero to memorize his speeches and by Medieval scholars to memorize entire books. Using methods that have been largely forgotten; Foer discovers that we can all dramatically improve our memories.  Immersing himself obsessively in a quirky subculture of competitive memorizers; Foer learns to apply techniques that call on imagination as much as determination--showing that memorization can be anything but rote. From the PAO system; which converts numbers into lurid images; to the memory palace; in which memories are stored in the rooms of imaginary structures; Foer's experience shows that the World Memory Championships are less a test of memory than of perseverance and creativity.  Foer takes his inquiry well beyond the arena of mental athletes-across the country and deep into his own mind. In San Diego; he meets an affable old man with one of the most severe case of amnesia on record; where he learns that memory is at once more elusive and more reliable than we might think. In Salt Lake City; he swaps secrets with a savant who claims to have memorized more than nine thousand books. At a high school in the South Bronx; he finds a history teacher using twenty- five-hundred-year-old memory techniques to give his students an edge in the state Regents exam.  At a time when electronic devices have all but rendered our individual memories obsolete; Foer's bid to resurrect the forgotten art of remembering becomes an urgent quest. Moonwalking with Einstein brings Joshua Foer to the apex of the U.S. Memory Championship and readers to a profound appreciation of a gift we all possess but that too often slips our minds.",English,USA,307,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347705105l/6346975.jpg,Random House,1988-01-01,Joshua Foer,Nonfiction|Science|Psychology|Self Help|Autobiography|Memoir

9780440241360,The Rule of Four,An ivy league murder; a mysterious coded manuscript and the secrets of a Renaissance prince collide memorably in this debut novel; that weaves together suspense and scholarship; high art and unimaginable treachery.An ivy league murder; a mysterious coded manuscript; and the secrets of a Renaissance prince collide memorably in The Rule of Four -- a brilliant work of fiction that weaves together suspense and scholarship; high art and unimaginable treachery.It's Easter at Princeton. Seniors are scrambling to finish their theses. And two students; Tom Sullivan and Paul Harris; are a hair's breadth from solving the mysteries of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili--a renowned text attributed to an Italian nobleman; a work that has baffled scholars since its publication in 1499. For Tom; their research has been a link to his family's past -- and an obstacle to the woman he loves. For Paul; it has become an obsession; the very reason for living. But as their deadline looms; research has stalled -- until a long-lost diary surfaces with a vital clue. And when a fellow researcher is murdered just hours later; Tom and Paul realize that they are not the first to glimpse the Hypnerotomachia 's secrets.Suddenly the stakes are raised; and as the two friends sift through the codes and riddles at the heart of the text; they are beginnning to see the manuscript in a new light--not simply as a story of faith; eroticism and pedantry; but as a bizarre; coded mathematical maze. And as they come closer and closer to deciphering the final puzzle of a book that has shattered careers; friendships and families; they know that their own lives are in mortal danger. Because at least one person has been killed for knowing too much. And they know even more.From the streets of fifteenth-century Rome to the rarified realm of the Ivy League; from a shocking 500 year-old murder scene to the drama of a young man's coming of age; The Rule of Four takes us on an entertaining; illuminating tour of history--as it builds to a pinnacle of nearly unbearable suspense.,English,USA,450,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389185899l/18431.jpg,Random House,1970-02-01,Ian Caldwell|Dustin Thomason,Fiction|Mystery|Thriller|Historical|Historical Fiction

Seen through the eyes of young Linda Fallon and the young man who loves her.Anita Shreve; the bestselling author of The Pilot's Wife; returns with a dazzling new novel about love; forgiveness; and paths not followed. Linda Fallon encounters her former lover; Thomas Janes; at a literary festival where both have been invited to give readings from their work. It has been years since their paths crossed; and in that time Thomas has become a kind of literary legend. His renown is enhanced by his elusiveness; for most of the past decade; he has remained in seclusion following a devastating loss. This is no chance meeting. Thomas learned that Linda was reading at the festival and chose this moment to reestablish contact with a woman he passionately pursued years earlier. Their affair was disastrous; and a turning point in both their lives. Neither the intensity of their relationship nor the damage it did has ever been far from his memory. From the moment they speak; The Last Time They Met unfolds the story of Linda and Thomas in an extraordinary way: it travels back into their past; bypassing layers of memory and interpretation to present their earlier encounters with unshakable immediacy. In Africa; when Linda and Thomas were twenty-seven; and in Massachusetts; when they were in high school; the novel re-creates love at its exhilarating pinnacle - the kind of intense connection that becomes the true north against which all relationships are measured. Moving backward through time; The Last Time They Met traces the extraordinary resonance a single choice; even a single word; can have over the course of a lifetime. At the same time; the novel creates an almost unbearable mystery; a mystery that can only be understood fully in the novel's final pages; in the eyes of young Linda Fallon and the young man who loves her.

Is it culture; the weather; geography? Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies are? Simply; no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise; how to explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world; while other African nations; such as Zimbabwe; the Congo; and Sierra Leone; are mired in poverty and violence? Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). Korea; to take just one of their fascinating examples; is a remarkably homogeneous nation; yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society that created incentives; rewarded innovation; and allowed everyone to participate in economic opportunities. The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly; the people of the north have endured decades of famine; political repression; and very different economic institutionsâ€”with no end in sight. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional trajectories. Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire; the Mayan city-states; medieval Venice; the Soviet Union; Latin America; England; Europe; the United States; and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today; including: Â Â  - China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed andÂ overwhelm the West? Â Â  - Are Americaâ€™s best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority? Â Â  - What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? More philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinsonâ€™s breakthrough ideas on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions?

Now; having left her father behind in Chicago for dreams of art school and marriage to an ambitious young doctor; she finds herself with a child of her own.

9780312421430,No Logo,"With a new Afterword to the 2002 edition; No Logo employs journalistic savvy and personal testament to detail the insidious practices and far-reaching effects of corporate marketingâ€”and the powerful potential of a growing activist sect that will surely alter the course of the 21st century. First published before the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle; this is an infuriating; inspiring; and altogether pioneering work of cultural criticism that investigates money; marketing; and the anti-corporate movement.As global corporations compete for the hearts and wallets of consumers who not only buy their products but willingly advertise them from head to toeâ€”witness today's schoolbooks; superstores; sporting arenas; and brand-name synergyâ€”a new generation has begun to battle consumerism with its own best weapons. In this provocative; well-written study; a front-line report on that battle; we learn how the Nike swoosh has changed from an athletic status-symbol to a metaphor for sweatshop labor; how teenaged McDonald's workers are risking their jobs to join the Teamsters; and how ""culture jammers"" utilize spray paint; computer-hacking acumen; and anti-propagandist wordplay to undercut the slogans and meanings of billboard ads (as in ""Joe Chemo"" for ""Joe Camel"").No Logo will challenge and enlighten students of sociology; economics; popular culture; international affairs; and marketing.""This book is not another account of the power of the select group of corporate Goliaths that have gathered to form our de facto global government. Rather; it is an attempt to analyze and document the forces opposing corporate rule; and to lay out the particular set of cultural and economic conditions that made the emergence of that opposition inevitable."" â€”Naomi Klein; from her Introduction",English,USA,528,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441567914l/647.jpg,Macmillan,1988-01-01,Naomi Klein,Nonfiction|Politics|Economics|Business|Sociology

His great-grandfather was beaten to death by the Klu Klux Klan for attempting to vote. His grandfather was prevented from voting by Klan intimidation; his father was barred by poll taxes and literacy tests. Today; Cotton cannot vote because he; like many black men in the United States; has been labeled a felon and is currently on parole.""As the United States celebrates the nation's ""triumph over race"" with the election of Barack Obama; the majority of young black men in major American cities are locked behind bars or have been labeled felons for life. Although Jim Crow laws have been wiped off the books; an astounding percentage of the African American community remains trapped in a subordinate status--much like their grandparents before them.In this incisive critique; former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. Alexander shows that; by targeting black men and decimating communities of color; the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control; even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community--and all of us--to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America.",English,USA,290,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328751532l/6792458.jpg,Hachette,2002-01-02,Michelle Alexander,Nonfiction|Politics|History|Race|Social Movements|Social Justice|Sociology
9780141185540,The Moon Is Down,"Taken by surprise; a small coastal town is overrun by an invading army with little resistance. The town is important because it is a port that serves a large coal mine. Colonel Lanser; the head of the invading battalion; along with his staff establishes his HQ in the house of the democratically elected and popular Mayor Orden.As the reality of occupation sinks in and the weather turns bleak; with the snows beginning earlier than usual; the ""simple; peaceful people"" of the town are angry and confused. Colonel Lanser; a veteran of many wars; tries to operate under a veil of civility and law; but in his heart he knows that ""there are no peaceful people"" amongst those whose freedom has been taken away by force. The veil is soon torn apart when Alexander Morden; an erstwhile alderman and ""a free man;"" is ordered to work in the mine. He strikes out at Captain Loft with a pick axe; but Captain Bentick steps into its path and dies of it. After a summary trial; Morden is executed by a firing squad. This incident catalyzes the people of the town and they settle into ""a slow; silent; waiting revenge."" Sections of the railroad linking the port with the mine get damaged regularly; the machinery breaks down often; and the dynamo of the electricity generators gets short circuited. Whenever a soldier relaxes his guard; drinks or goes out with a woman; he is killed. Mayor Orden stands by his people; and tries to explain to Col. Lanser that his goal â€""to break manâ€™s spirit permanently"" â€is impossible.The cold weather and the constant fear weighs heavy on the occupying force; many of whom wish the war to end so that they can return home. They realize the futility of the war and that ""the flies have conquered the flypaper."" Some members of the resistance escape to England and ask the English for explosives so that the townspeople can intensify their efforts. English planes parachute-drop small packages containing dynamite sticks and chocolates all around the town. In a state of panic; the army takes the Mayor and his friend Dr. Winter; the town doctor and historian; hostage and lets it be known that any action from resistance will lead to their execution. Mayor Orden knows that nothing can stop his people and that his death is imminent. He tells his wife that while he can be killed; the idea of Mayor (and freedom and democracy) is beyond the reach of any army. Before his execution; Mayor Orden reminds Dr. Winter of the dialogues of Socrates in the Apology; a part he played in the high school play; and tells him to make sure that the debt is repaid to the army; i.e.; that the resistance is continued.",English,USA,144,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327961310l/12722.jpg,Macmillan,2012-08-09,John Steinbeck,Fiction|Classics|Historical|Historical Fiction|War|Literature

9780006280900,The Four Loves,"The Four Loves summarizes four kinds of human love--affection; friendship; erotic love; and the love of God. Masterful without being magisterial; this book's wise; gentle; candid reflections on the virtues and dangers of love draw on sources from Jane Austen to St. Augustine. The chapter on charity (love of God) may be the best thing Lewis ever wrote about Christianity. Consider his reflection on Augustine's teaching that one must love only God; because only God is eternal; and all earthly love will someday pass away:  Who could conceivably begin to love God on such a prudential ground--because the security (so to speak) is better? Who could even include it among the grounds for loving? Would you choose a wife or a Friend--if it comes to that; would you choose a dog--in this spirit? One must be outside the world of love; of all loves; before one thus calculates.  His description of Christianity here is no less forceful and opinionated than in Mere Christianity or The Problem of Pain; but it is far less anxious about its reader's response--and therefore more persuasive than any of his apologetics. When he begins to describe the nature of faith; Lewis writes: ""Take it as one man's reverie; almost one man's myth. If anything in it is useful to you; use it; if anything is not; never give it a second thought."" --Michael Joseph Gross",English,USA,170,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1276287504l/30633.jpg,Harper Collins,2010-05-05,C.S.

Stories remarkable in their range; emotional force; and dark laughter; and in the sheer beauty and power of their language.From the opening story; ""Willing""; about a second-rate movie actress in her thirties who has moved back to Chicago; where she makes a seedy motel room her home and becomes involved with a mechanic who has not the least idea of who she is as a human being; Birds of America unfolds a startlingly brilliant series of portraits of the unhinged; the lost; the unsettled of our America. In the story ""Which Is More Than I Can Say About Some People"" (""There is nothing as complex in the world--no flower or stone--as a single hello from a human being""); a woman newly separated from her husband is on a long-planned trip through Ireland with her mother. When they set out on an expedition to kiss the Blarney Stone; the image of wisdom and success that her mother has always put forth slips away to reveal the panicky woman she really is. In ""Charades;"" a family game at Christmas is transformed into a hilarious and insightful (and fundamentally upsetting) revelation of crumbling family ties. In ""Community Life;""a shy; almost reclusive; librarian; Transylvania-born and Vermont-bred; moves in with her boyfriend; the local anarchist in a small university town; and all hell breaks loose. And in ""Four Calling Birds; Three French Hens;"" a woman who goes through the stages of grief as she mourns the death of her cat (Anger; Denial; Bargaining; Haagen Dazs; Rage) is seen by her friends as really mourning other issues: the impending death of her parents; the son she never had; Bosnia.In what may be her most stunning book yet; Lorrie Moore explores the personal and the universal; the idiosyncratic and the mundane; with all the wit; brio; and verve that have made her one of the best storytellers of our time.",English,USA,291,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388641896l/19631.jpg,Harper Collins,2010-05-05,Lorrie Moore,Short Stories|Fiction|Literary Fiction|Contemporary

9781840232040,The Sandman: The Dream Hunters,"Sandman fans should feel lucky that master fantasy writer Neil Gaiman discovered the mythical world of Japanese fables while researching his translation of Hayao Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke. At the same time; while preparing for the Sandman 10th anniversary; he met Yoshitaka Amano; his artist for the 11th Sandman book. Amano is the famed designer of the Final Fantasy game series. The product of Gaiman's immersion in Japanese art; culture; and history; Sandman: Dream Hunters is a classic Japanese tale (adapted from ""The Fox; the Monk; and the Mikado of All Night's Dreaming"") that he has subtly morphed into his Sandman universe.Like most fables; the story begins with a wager between two jealous animals; a fox and a badger: which of them can drive a young monk from his solitary temple? The winner will make the temple into a new fox or badger home. But as the fox adopts the form of a woman to woo the monk from his hermitage; she falls in love with him. Meanwhile; in far away Kyoto; the wealthy Master of Yin-Yang; the onmyoji; is plagued by his fears and seeks tranquility in his command of sorcery. He learns of the monk and his inner peace; he dispatches demons to plague the monk in his dreams and eventually kill him to bring his peace to the onmyoji. The fox overhears the demons on their way to the monk and begins her struggle to save the man whom at first she so envied.Dream Hunters is a beautiful package. From the ink-brush painted endpapers to the luminous page layouts--including Amano's gate-fold painting of Morpheus in a sea of reds; oranges; and violets--this book has been crafted for a sensuous reading experience. Gaiman has developed as a prose stylist in the last several years with novels and stories such as Neverwhere and Stardust; and his narrative rings with a sense of timelessness and magic that gently sustains this adult fairy tale. The only disappointment here is that the book is so brief. One could imagine this creative team being even better suited to a longer story of more epic proportions. On the final page of Dream Hunters; in fact; Amano suggest that he will collaborate further with Mr. Gaiman in the future. Readers of Dream Hunters will hope that Amano's dream comes true. --Patrick O'Kelley",English,USA,128,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327940077l/166580.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1988-01-01,Neil Gaiman|Yoshitaka Amano,Sequential Art|Graphic Novels|Fantasy|Sequential Art|Comics|Fiction

9780310266300,The Irresistible Revolution: Living as an Ordinary Radical,Living as an Ordinary RadicalMany of us find ourselves caught somewhere between unbelieving activists and inactive believers. We can write a check to feed starving children or hold signs in the streets and feel like weâ€™ve made a difference without ever encountering the faces of the suffering masses. In this book; Shane Claiborne describes an authentic faith rooted in belief; action; and love; inviting us into a movement of the Spirit that begins inside each of us and extends into a broken world. Shaneâ€™s faith led him to dress the wounds of lepers with Mother Teresa; visit families in Iraq amidst bombings; and dump $10;000 in coins and bills on Wall Street to redistribute wealth. Shane lives out this revolution each day in his local neighborhood; an impoverished community in North Philadelphia; by living among the homeless; helping local kids with homework; and â€œpracticing resurrectionâ€in the forgotten places of our world.

9780307265720,1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created,From the author of 1491â€”the best-selling study of the pre-Columbian Americasâ€”a deeply engaging new history of the most momentous biological event since the death of the dinosaurs. More than 200 million years ago; geological forces split apart the continents. Isolated from each other; the two halves of the world developed radically different suites of plants and animals. When Christopher Columbus set foot in the Americas; he ended that separation at a stroke. Driven by the economic goal of establishing trade with China; he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new homes across the oceans. The Columbian Exchange; as researchers call it; is the reason there are tomatoes in Italy; oranges in Florida; chocolates in Switzerland; and chili peppers in Thailand. More important; creatures the colonists knew nothing about hitched along for the ride. Earthworms; mosquitoes; and cockroaches; honeybees; dandelions; and African grasses; bacteria; fungi; and viruses; rats of every descriptionâ€”all of them rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like before; changing lives and landscapes across the planet. Eight decades after Columbus; a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China; then the richest; most powerful country in the world. In Manila; a city Legazpi founded; silver from the Americas; mined by African and Indian slaves; was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the first time that goods and people from every corner of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically; Legazpi and the Spanish empire he served created a new world economically.As Charles C. Mann shows; the Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent human history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists; anthropologists; archaeologists; and historians; Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of ecological and economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe; devastated imperial China; convulsed Africa; and for two centuries made Mexico Cityâ€”where Asia; Europe; and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interactedâ€”the center of the world. In such encounters; he uncovers the germ of todayâ€™s fiercest political disputes; from immigration to trade policy to culture wars.In 1493; Charles Mann gives us an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past; unequaled in its authority and fascination,English,USA,557,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327900945l/9862761.jpg,Random House,1970-02-01,Charles C.

9780385341070,Mister Pip,In a novel that is at once intense; beautiful; and fablelike; Lloyd Jones weaves a transcendent story that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the power of narrative to transform our lives.On a copper-rich tropical island shattered by war; where the teachers have fled with most everyone else; only one white man chooses to stay behind: the eccentric Mr. Watts; object of much curiosity and scorn; who sweeps out the ruined schoolhouse and begins to read to the children each day from Charles Dickens's classic Great Expectations.So begins this rare; original story about the abiding strength that imagination; once ignited; can provide. As artillery echoes in the mountains; thirteen-year-old Matilda and her peers are riveted by the adventures of a young orphan named Pip in a city called London; a city whose contours soon become more real than their own blighted landscape. As Mr. Watts says; â€œA person entranced by a book simply forgets to breathe.â€Soon come the rest of the villagers; initially threatened; finally inspired to share tales of their own that bring alive the rich mythology of their past. But in a ravaged place where even children are forced to live by their wits and daily survival is the only objective; imagination can be a dangerous thing.,English,UK,256,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1308963140l/543873.jpg,Crossley,1970-02-01,Lloyd Jones,Historical|Historical Fiction|War|Young Adult|Contemporary

9780375753830,Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire,The winner of Britain's prestigious Whitbread Prize and a bestseller there for months; this wonderfully readable biography offers a rich; rollicking picture of late-eighteenth-century British aristocracy and the intimate story of a woman who for a time was its undisputed leader.Lady Georgiana Spencer was the great-great-great-great-aunt of Diana; Princess of Wales; and was nearly as famous in her day. In 1774; at the age of seventeen; Georgiana achieved immediate celebrity by marrying one of England's richest and most influential aristocrats; the Duke of Devonshire. Launched into a world of wealth and power; she quickly became the queen of fashionable society; adored by the Prince of Wales; a dear friend of Marie-Antoinette; and leader of the most important salon of her time. Not content with the role of society hostess; she used her connections to enter politics; eventually becoming more influential than most of the men who held office. Her good works and social exploits made her loved by the multitudes; but Georgiana's public success; like Diana's; concealed a personal life that was fraught with suffering. The Duke of Devonshire was unimpressed by his wife's legendary charms; preferring instead those of her closest friend; a woman with whom Georgiana herself was rumored to be on intimate terms. For over twenty years; the three lived together in a jealous and uneasy mÃ©nage Ã  trois; during which time both women bore the Duke's childrenâ€”as well as those of other men.Foreman's descriptions of Georgiana's uncontrollable gambling; all-night drinking; drug taking; and love affairs with the leading politicians of the day give us fascinating insight into the lives of the British aristocracy in the era of the madness of King George III; the American and French revolutions; and the defeat of Napoleon. A gifted young historian whom critics are already likening to Antonia Fraser; Amanda Foreman draws on a wealth of fresh research and writes colorfully and penetratingly about the fascinating Georgiana; whose struggle against her own weaknesses; whose great beauty and flamboyance; and whose determination to play a part in the affairs of the world make her a vibrant; astonishingly contemporary figure.,English,USA,456,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1332041559l/319300.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2012-08-09,Amanda Foreman,History|Biography|Nonfiction|Historical

9780743262130,The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal; 1870-1914,On December 31; 1999; after nearly a century of rule; the United States officially ceded ownership of the Panama Canal to the nation of Panama. That nation did not exist when; in the mid-19th century; Europeans first began to explore the possibilities of creating a link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the narrow but mountainous isthmus; Panama was then a remote and overlooked part of Colombia.All that changed; writes David McCullough in his magisterial history of the Canal; in 1848; when prospectors struck gold in California. A wave of fortune seekers descended on Panama from Europe and the eastern United States; seeking quick passage on California-bound ships in the Pacific; and the Panama Railroad; built to serve that traffic; was soon the highest-priced stock listed on the New York Exchange. To build a 51-mile-long ship canal to replace that railroad seemed an easy matter to some investors. But; as McCullough notes; the construction project came to involve the efforts of thousands of workers from many nations over four decades; eventually those workers; laboring in oppressive heat in a vast malarial swamp; removed enough soil and rock to build a pyramid a mile high. In the early years; they toiled under the direction of French entrepreneur Ferdinand de Lesseps; who went bankrupt while pursuing his dream of extending France's empire in the Americas. The United States then entered the picture; with President Theodore Roosevelt orchestrating the purchase of the canalâ€”but not before helping foment a revolution that removed Panama from Colombian rule and placed it squarely in the American camp.,English,UK,697,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388197198l/2372.jpg,Penguin,2002-01-02,David McCullough,Nonfiction|History|North American Hi...|American History|Historical

9780140092510,Chaos: Making a New Science,Few writers distinguish themselves by their ability to write about complicated; even obscure topics clearly and engagingly. In Chaos; James Gleick; a former science writer for the New York Times; shows that he resides in this exclusive category. Here he takes on the job of depicting the first years of the study of chaos--the seemingly random patterns that characterise many natural phenomena. This is not a purely technical book. Instead; it focuses as much on the scientists studying chaos as on the chaos itself. In the pages of Gleick's book; the reader meets dozens of extraordinary and eccentric people. For instance; Mitchell Feigenbaum; who constructed and regulated his life by a 26-hour clock and watched his waking hours come in and out of phase with those of his coworkers at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As for chaos itself; Gleick does an outstanding job of explaining the thought processes and investigative techniques that researchers bring to bear on chaos problems. Rather than attempt to explain Julia sets; Lorenz attractors and the Mandelbrot Set with gigantically complicated equations; Chaos relies on sketches; photographs and Gleick's wonderful descriptive prose. --Christine Buttery,English,USA,352,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327941595l/64582.jpg,Crossley,2010-05-05,James Gleick,Science|Nonfiction|Science|Mathematics|Science|Physics

9780060652390,A Grief Observed,"Written with love; humility; and faith; this brief but poignant volume was first published in 1961 and concerns the death of C. S. Lewis's wife; the American-born poet Joy Davidman. In her introduction to this new edition; Madeleine L'Engle writes: ""I am grateful to Lewis for having the courage to yell; to doubt; to kick at God in angry violence. This is a part of a healthy grief which is not often encouraged. It is helpful indeed that C. S. Lewis; who has been such a successful apologist for Christianity; should have the courage to admit doubt about what he has so superbly proclaimed. It gives us permission to admit our own doubts; our own angers and anguishes; and to know that they are part of the soul's growth.""Written in longhand in notebooks that Lewis found in his home; A Grief Observed probes the ""mad midnight moments"" of Lewis's mourning and loss; moments in which he questioned what he had previously believed about life and death; marriage; and even God. Indecision and self-pity assailed Lewis. ""We are under the harrow and can't escape;"" he writes. ""I know that the thing I want is exactly the thing I can never get. The old life; the jokes; the drinks; the arguments; the lovemaking; the tiny; heartbreaking commonplace."" Writing A Grief Observed as ""a defense against total collapse; a safety valve;"" he came to recognize that ""bereavement is a universal and integral part of our experience of love.""Lewis writes his statement of faith with precision; humor; and grace. Yet neither is Lewis reluctant to confess his continuing doubts and his awareness of his own human frailty. This is precisely the quality which suggests that A Grief Observed may become ""among the great devotional books of our age.""",English,USA,112,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412529325l/49221.jpg,Hachette,2002-01-02,C.S.

9781439177810,Unbearable Lightness: A Story of Loss and Gain,"""I didn't decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet; a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .""Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard workâ€”first as a child model in Australia; then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond; glamorous and successful. On the inside; she was literally dying.In this searing; unflinchingly honest book; Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food; weight; and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day; from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn't enough; she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise; driving her body and spirit to the breaking point.Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development; Portia alternately starved herself and binged; all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet; a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet; Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder.From her lowest point; Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty; falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres; and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women's health issues.In this remarkable and beautifully written work; Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies; Unbearable Lightness is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.",English,UK,320,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1292739170l/9219901.jpg,Crossley,2010-05-05,Portia de Rossi,Nonfiction|Biography|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography|Autobiography|Lgbt

9780310245650,What's So Amazing About Grace?,Original Cover Edition for ISBN 0310245656In 1987; an IRA bomb buried Gordon Wilson and his twenty-year-old daughter beneath five feet of rubble. Gordon alone survived. And forgave. He said of the bombers; ' I have lost my daughter; but I bear no grudge . . . I shall pray; tonight and every night; that God will forgive them.' His words caught the media's ears Â— and out of one man's grief; the world got a glimpse of grace. Grace is the church's great distinctive. It's the one thing the world cannot duplicate; and the one thing it craves above all else Â— for only grace can bring hope and transformation to a jaded world. In What's So Amazing About Grace? award-winning author Philip Yancey explores grace at street level. If grace is God's love for the undeserving; he asks; then what does it look like in action? And if Christians are its sole dispensers; then how are we doing at lavishing grace on a world that knows far more of cruelty and unforgiveness than it does of mercy? Yancey sets grace in the midst of life's stark images; tests its mettle against horrific 'ungrace.' Can grace survive in the midst of such atrocities as the Nazi holocaust? Can it triumph over the brutality of the Ku Klux Klan? Should any grace at all be shown to the likes of Jeffrey Dahmer; who killed and cannibalized seventeen young men? Grace does not excuse sin; says Yancey; but it treasures the sinner. True grace is shocking; scandalous. It shakes our conventions with its insistence on getting close to sinners and touching them with mercy and hope. It forgives the unfaithful spouse; the racist; the child abuser. It loves today's AIDS-ridden addict as much as the tax collector of Jesus' day. In his most personal and provocative book ever; Yancey offers compelling; true portraits of grace's life-changing power. He searches for its presence in his own life and in the church. He asks; How can Christians contend graciously with moral issues that threaten all they hold dear? And he challenges us to become living answers to a world that desperately wants to know; What's So Amazing About Grace?,English,USA,304,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328050483l/53817.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Philip Yancey,Christian|Nonfiction|Religion|Christianity|Religion|Religion|Theology|Religion|Faith|Christian|Christian Living
9780374116350,Breath,Tim Winton is Australiaâ€™s best-loved novelist. His new work; Breath; is an extraordinary evocation of an adolescence spent resisting complacency; testing oneâ€™s limits against nature; finding like-minded souls; and discovering just how far one breath will take you. Itâ€™s a story of extremesâ€”extreme sports and extreme emotions. On the wild; lonely coast of Western Australia; two thrillseeking and barely adolescent boys fall into the enigmatic thrall of veteran big-wave surfer Sando. Together they form an odd but elite trio. The grown man initiates the boys into a kind of Spartan ethos; a regimen of risk and challenge; where they test themselves in storm swells on remote and shark-infested reefs; pushing each other to the edges of endurance; courage; and sanity. But where is all this heading? Why is their mentorâ€™s past such forbidden territory? And what can explain his American wifeâ€™s peculiar behavior? Venturing beyond all limitsâ€”in relationships; in physical challenge; and in sexual behaviorâ€”there is a point where oblivion is the only outcome. Full of Wintonâ€™s lyrical genius for conveying physical sensation; Breath is a rich and atmospheric coming-of-age tale from one of world literatureâ€™s finest storytellers.,English,USA,218,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1317792624l/2176735.jpg,Hachette,2012-08-09,Tim Winton,Fiction|Cultural|Australia|Contemporary|Young Adult|Coming Of Age

9780684865190,The Seat of the Soul, A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: This hardcover edition of The Seat of the Soul celebrates its tenth anniversary. The Seat of the Soul became a national bestseller when it was first published; but more people are buying it now than ever before. Why is this?  It is because a new species is being born. The Seat of the Soul is about this birth. This new species longs for harmony; cooperation; sharing; and reverence for Life. It uses higher orders of logic and justice -- those of the heart. The number of people who are becoming aware of this birth is growing very fast; because the new species is being born inside all of us.  The Seat of the Soul provides a vocabulary for this new species -- a vocabulary of authentic power; the alignment of the personality with the soul. Human experience is exploding beyond the five senses; and The Seat of the Soul is about that; too. This is the most exciting time to be on Earth; and The Seat of the Soul describes why.  As we become aware of our new abilities and values; like a baby opening its eyes and stretching its arms and legs for the first time; we are also becoming aware of an entirely new potential that we have never had before. I have been writing a book about this new potential for nine years. I am looking forward to sharing that with you; too.  The tremendous growth of interest in The Seat of the Soul is humbling to me. I dream of a world where people respect each other and the living Earth; and spiritual growth is the first priority. I work daily to develop the awareness; compassion; and intentions that are necessary to create it. The extraordinary reception of The Seat of the Soul shows me; among other things; how many fellow souls are doing the same.  The more this happens; the more I see myself; with gratitude; as a traveler among travelers; an experimenter among experimenters; and a soul among souls.

9780847829870,On Ugliness,"In the mold of his acclaimed ""History of Beauty;"" renowned cultural critic Umberto Eco's ""On Ugliness"" is an exploration of the monstrous and the repellant in visual culture and the arts. What is the voyeuristic impulse behind our attraction to the gruesome and the horrible? Where does the magnetic appeal of the sordid and the scandalous come from? Is ugliness also in the eye of the beholder? Eco's encyclopedic knowledge and captivating storytelling skills combine in this ingenious study of the Ugly; revealing that what we often shield ourselves from and shun in everyday life is what we're most attracted to subliminally. Topics range from Milton's Satan to Goethe's Mephistopheles; from witchcraft and medieval torture tactics to martyrs; hermits; and penitents; from lunar births and disemboweled corpses to mythic monsters and sideshow freaks; and from Decadentism and picturesque ugliness to the tacky; kitsch; and camp; and the aesthetics of excess and vice. With abundant examples of painting and sculpture ranging from ancient Greek amphorae to Bosch; Brueghel; and Goya among others; and with quotations from the most celebrated writers and philosophers of each age; this provocative discussion explores in-depth the concepts of evil; depravity; and darkness in art and literature.",English,UK,456,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320443510l/520738.jpg,Hachette,2002-01-02,Umberto Eco,Art|Nonfiction|Philosophy|History|Art|Art History|Writing|Essays

Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that; but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it. The ""new physics"" of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory; particle physics; and relativity. Even as these theories age they haven't percolated all that far into the collective consciousness; they're too far removed from mundane human experience not to need introduction. The Dancing Wu Li Masters remains an engaging; accessible way to meet the most profound and mind-altering insights of 20th-century science. --Mary Ellen Curtin",English,USA,416,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1410138626l/64794.jpg,Macmillan,1988-01-01,Gary Zukav,Science|Nonfiction|Science|Physics|Philosophy|Spirituality
9780307408860,Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1; 1915; a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York; bound for Liverpool; carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were anxious. Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone; and for months; its U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era's great transatlantic ""Greyhounds"" and her captain; William Thomas Turner; placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. He knew; moreover; that his ship - the fastest then in service - could outrun any threat. Germany; however; was determined to change the rules of the game; and Walther Schwieger; the captain of Unterseeboot-20; was happy to oblige. Meanwhile; an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger's U-boat; but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool; an array of forces both grand and achingly small - hubris; a chance fog; a closely guarded secret; and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don't; and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly; switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour; mystery; and real-life suspense; Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters; from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope Riddle to President Wilson; a man lost to grief; dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.

9780307395990,Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's,Ever since he was small; John Robison had longed to connect with other people; but by the time he was a teenager; his odd habitsâ€”an inclination to blurt out non sequiturs; avoid eye contact; dismantle radios; and dig five-foot holes (and stick his younger brother in them)â€”had earned him the label â€œsocial deviant.â€No guidance came from his mother; who conversed with light fixtures; or his father; who spent evenings pickling himself in sherry. It was no wonder he gravitated to machines; which could; at least; be counted on.After fleeing his parents and dropping out of high school; his savant-like ability to visualize electronic circuits landed him a gig with KISS; for whom he created their legendary fire-breathing guitars. Later; he drifted into a â€œrealâ€job; as an engineer for a major toy company. But the higher Robison rose in the company; the more he had to pretend to be â€œnormalâ€and do what he simply couldnâ€™t: communicate. It wasnâ€™t worth the paycheck.It was not until he was forty that an insightful therapist told him he had the form of autism called Aspergerâ€™s syndrome. That understanding transformed the way Robison saw himselfâ€”and the world.Look Me in the Eye is the moving; darkly funny story of growing up with Aspergerâ€™s at a time when the diagnosis simply didnâ€™t exist. A born storyteller; Robison takes you inside the head of a boy whom teachers and other adults regarded as â€œdefective;â€who could not avail himself of KISSâ€™s endless supply of groupies; and who still has a peculiar aversion to using peopleâ€™s given names (he calls his wife â€œUnit Twoâ€. He also provides a fascinating reverse angle on the younger brother he left at the mercy of their nutty parentsâ€”the boy who would later change his name to Augusten Burroughs and write the bestselling memoir Running with Scissors.Ultimately; this is the story of Robisonâ€™s journey from his world into ours; and his new life as a husband; father; and successful small business ownerâ€”repairing his beloved high-end automobiles.

9780061707800,Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality,"Since Darwin's day; we've been told that sexual monogamy comes naturally to our species. Mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married; and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages.How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be; according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda JethÃ¡. While debunking almost everything we ""know"" about sex; they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book.Ryan and JethÃ¡'s central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food; child care; and; often; sexual partners. Weaving together convergent; frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology; archaeology; primatology; anatomy; and psychosexuality; the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar; intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love; cooperation; and generosity.With intelligence; humor; and wonder; Ryan and JethÃ¡ show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy; sexual orientation; and family dynamics. They explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality.In the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing; Sex at Dawn unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.",English,USA,400,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1291105594l/7640261.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2002-01-02,Christopher  Ryan|Cacilda JethÃ¡,Nonfiction|Science|History|Sexuality|Psychology|Anthropology

9780061730320,The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope,"William Kamkwamba was born in Malawi; a country where magic ruled and modern science was mystery. It was also a land withered by drought and hunger; and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy; and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misalaâ€”crazyâ€”but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do.Enchanted by the workings of electricity as a boy; William had a goal to study science in Malawi's top boarding schools. But in 2002; his country was stricken with a famine that left his family's farm devastated and his parents destitute. Unable to pay the eighty-dollar-a-year tuition for his education; William was forced to drop out and help his family forage for food as thousands across the country starved and died.Yet William refused to let go of his dreams. With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach; a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks; and an armory of curiosity and determination; he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessityâ€”electricity and running water. Using scrap metal; tractor parts; and bicycle halves; William forged a crude yet operable windmill; an unlikely contraption and small miracle that eventually powered four lights; complete with homemade switches and a circuit breaker made from nails and wire. A second machine turned a water pump that could battle the drought and famine that loomed with every season.Soon; news of William's magetsi a mphepoâ€”his ""electric wind""â€”spread beyond the borders of his home; and the boy who was once called crazy became an inspiration to those around the world.Here is the remarkable story about human inventiveness and its power to overcome crippling adversity.

9780307700670,Going Clear: Scientology; Hollywood; and the Prison of Belief,"A clear-sighted revelation; a deep penetration into the world of Scientology by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the now-classic study of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack; the Looming Tower. Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with both current and former Scientologists--both famous and less well known--and years of archival research; Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative skills to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology: its origins in the imagination of science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard; its struggles to find acceptance as a legitimate (and legally acknowledged) religion; its vast; secret campaign to infiltrate the U.S. government; and its dramatic efforts to grow and prevail after the death of Hubbard.At the book's center; two men whom Wright brings vividly to life; showing how they have made Scientology what it is today: The darkly brilliant L. Ron Hubbard--whose restless; expansive mind invented a new religion tailor-made to prosper in the spiritually troubled post-World War II era. And his successor; David Miscavige--tough and driven; with the unenviable task of preserving the church in the face of ongoing scandals and continual legal assaults.We learn about Scientology's esoteric cosmology; about the auditing process that determines an inductee's state of being; about the Bridge to Total Freedom; through which members gain eternal life. We see the ways in which the church pursues celebrities; such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta; and how young idealists who joined the Sea Org; the church's clergy; whose members often enter as children; signing up with a billion-year contract and working with little pay in poor conditions. We meet men and women ""disconnected"" from friends and family by the church's policy of shunning critical voices. And we discover; through many firsthand stories; the violence that has long permeated the inner sanctum of the church.In Going Clear; Wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion; and whether Scientology is; in fact; deserving of the constitutional protections achieved in its victory over the IRS. Employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observations; understanding; and synthesis; and his ability to shape a story into a compelling narrative; Lawrence Wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that goes far beyond an immediate exposÃ© and uncovers the very essence of what makes Scientology the institution it is.",English,USA,430,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358119149l/16142053.jpg,Harper Collins,2002-01-02,Lawrence Wright,Nonfiction|Religion|History|Audiobook

9780691097500,The I Ching or Book of Changes,The I Ching; or Book of Changes; is one of the 1st efforts of the human mind to place itself within the universe. It has exerted a living influence in China for 3000 years and interest in it has spread in the West. Set down in the dawn of history as a book of oracles; the Book of Changes deepened in meaning when ethical values were attached to the oracular pronouncements; it became a book of wisdom; eventually one of the Five Classics of Confucianism; and provided the common source for both Confucianist and Taoist philosophy. Wilhelm's rendering of the I Ching into German; published in 1924; presented it for the 1st time in a form intelligible to the general reader. Wilhelm; who translated many other ancient Chinese works and who wrote several books on Chinese philosophy and civilization; long resided in China. His close association with its cultural leaders gave him a unique understanding of the text of the I Ching. In the English translation; every effort has been made to preserve Wilhelm's pioneering insight into the spirit of the original.This 3rd edition; completely reset; contains a new forward by Hellmut Wilhelm; one of the most eminent American scholars of Chinese culture. He discusses his father's textual methods and summarizes recent studies of the I Ching both in the West and in present-day China.

Mario; the son of Mama and Papa Bellini; proprietors of the subway-station newsstand; had only heard the sound once. What was this new; strangely musical chirping? None other than the mellifluous leg-rubbing of the somewhat disoriented Chester Cricket from Connecticut. Attracted by the irresistible smell of liverwurst; Chester had foolishly jumped into the picnic basket of some unsuspecting New Yorkers on a junket to the country. Despite the insect's wurst intentions; he ends up in a pile of dirt in Times Square. Mario is elated to find Chester. He begs his parents to let him keep the shiny insect in the newsstand; assuring his bug-fearing mother that crickets are harmless; maybe even good luck. What ensues is an altogether captivating spin on the city mouse/country mouse story; as Chester adjusts to the bustle of the big city. Despite the cricket's comfortable matchbox bed (with Kleenex sheets); the fancy; seven-tiered pagoda cricket cage from Sai Fong's novelty shop; tasty mulberry leaves; the jolly company of Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat; and even his new-found fame as ""the most famous musician in New York City;"" Chester begins to miss his peaceful life in the Connecticut countryside. The Cricket in Times Square--a Newbery Honor Book in 1961--is charmingly illustrated by the well-loved Garth Williams; and the tiniest details of this elegantly spun; vividly told; surprisingly suspenseful tale will stick with children for years and years.

9780743492830,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,A brilliantly written; funny; honest; inspiring; and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life which will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.One of the most extraordinary survival stories ever told -- Aron Ralston's searing account of his six days trapped in one of the most remote spots in America; and how one inspired act of bravery brought him home. It started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston; a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman; a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation; and though he met two charming women along the way; by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone; with just the beauty of the natural world all around him. It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck; in a deep and narrow slot canyon; Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly; and terrifyingly; came loose. Before he could get out of the way; the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall. And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food; no jacket for the painfully cold nights; and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed; he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days; Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin; he'd most probably have died of dehydration; if a flash flood didn't drown him before that. What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack; Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country; thinking back over a life filled with adventure; and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part; his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron; the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive; until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself. Between a Rock and a Hard Place -- a brilliantly written; funny; honest; inspiring; and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.,English,USA,368,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442193831l/166562.jpg,Macmillan,2012-08-09,Aron Ralston,Nonfiction|Biography|Adventure|Autobiography|Memoir|Adventure|Survival

Even the oldest and most technologically advanced of the galaxyâ€™s sentient races; the Raiel; do not know its origin; its makers; or its purpose.But then Inigo; an astrophysicist studying the Void; begins dreaming of human beings who live within it. Inigoâ€™s dreams reveal a world in which thoughts become actions and dreams become reality. Inside the Void; Inigo sees paradise. Thanks to the gaiafield; a neural entanglement wired into most humans; Inigoâ€™s dreams are shared by hundreds of millionsâ€“and a religion; the Living Dream; is born; with Inigo as its prophet. But then he vanishes.Suddenly there is a new wave of dreams. Dreams broadcast by an unknown Second Dreamer serve as the inspiration for a massive Pilgrimage into the Void. But there is a chance that by attempting to enter the Void; the pilgrims will trigger a catastrophic expansion; an accelerated devourment phase that will swallow up thousands of worlds. And thus begins a desperate race to find Inigo and the mysterious Second Dreamer. Some seek to prevent the Pilgrimage; others to speed its progressâ€“while within the Void; a supreme entity has turned its gaze; for the first time; outward. . . .From the Hardcover edition.,English,UK,630,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440047585l/866136.jpg,Harper Collins,2012-08-09,Peter F.

Meanwhile; the titanically talented Babe Ruth was beginning his assault on the home run record; which would culminate on September 30 with his sixtieth blast; one of the most resonant and durable records in sports history. In between those dates a Queens housewife named Ruth Snyder and her corset-salesman lover garroted her husband; leading to a murder trial that became a huge tabloid sensation. Alvin â€œShipwreckâ€Kelly sat atop a flagpole in Newark; New Jersey; for twelve daysâ€”a new record. The American South was clobbered by unprecedented rain and by flooding of the Mississippi basin; a great human disaster; the relief efforts for which were guided by the uncannily able and insufferably pompous Herbert Hoover. Calvin Coolidge interrupted an already leisurely presidency for an even more relaxing three-month vacation in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The gangster Al Capone tightened his grip on the illegal booze business through a gaudy and murderous reign of terror and municipal corruption. The first true â€œtalking picture;â€Al Jolsonâ€™s The Jazz Singer; was filmed and forever changed the motion picture industry. The four most powerful central bankers on earth met in secret session on a Long Island estate and made a fateful decision that virtually guaranteed a future crash and depression.Â Â Â Â  All this and much; much more transpired in that epochal summer of 1927; and Bill Bryson captures its outsized personalities; exciting events; and occasional just plain weirdness with his trademark vividness; eye for telling detail; and delicious humor. In that year America stepped out onto the world stage as the main event; and One Summer transforms it all into narrative nonfiction of the highest order.,English,UK,456,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1380292864l/17262366.jpg,Hachette,1988-01-01,Bill Bryson,History|Nonfiction|North American Hi...|American History|Audiobook

9780374521510,Mythologies,"""No denunciation without its proper instrument of close analysis;"" Roland Barthes wrote in his preface to Mythologies. There is no more proper instrument of analysis of our contemporary myths than this bookâ€”one of the most significant works in French theory; and one that has transformed the way readers and philosophers view the world around them.Our age is a triumph of codification. We own devices that bring the world to the command of our fingertips. We have access to boundless information and prodigious quantities of stuff. We decide to like or not; to believe or not; to buy or not. We pick and choose. We think we are free. Yet all around us; in pop culture; politics; mainstream media; and advertising; there are codes and symbols that govern our choices. They are the fabrications of consumer society. They express myths of success; well-being; or happiness. As Barthes sees it; these myths must be carefully deciphered; and debunked.What Barthes discerned in mass media; the fashion of plastic; and the politics of postcolonial France applies with equal force to today's social networks; the iPhone; and the images of 9/11. This new edition of Mythologies; complete and beautifully rendered by the Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning poet; critic; and translator Richard Howard; is a consecration of Barthes's classicâ€”a lesson in clairvoyance that is more relevant now than ever.",English,USA,160,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440640494l/51715.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2012-08-09,Roland Barthes|Annette Lavers,Philosophy|Nonfiction|Philosophy|Theory|Writing|Essays|Cultural|France|Fantasy|Mythology

9783426615360,How to Be Good,"In Nick Hornby's How to Be Good; Katie Carr is certainly trying to be. That's why she became a GP. That's why she cares about Third World debt and homelessness; and struggles to raise her children with a conscience. It's also why she puts up with her husband David; the self-styled Angriest Man in Holloway. But one fateful day; she finds herself in a Leeds parking lot; having just slept with another man. What Katie doesn't yet realize is that her fall from grace is just the first step on a spiritual journey more torturous than the interstate at rush hour. Because; prompted by his wife's actions; David is about to stop being angry. He's about to become good--not politically correct; organic-food-eating good; but good in the fashion of the Gospels. And that's no easier in modern-day Holloway than it was in ancient Israel.  Hornby means us to take his title literally: How can we be good; and what does that mean? However; quite apart from demanding that his readers scrub their souls with the nearest available Brillo pad; he also mesmerizes us with that cocktail of wit and compassion that has become his trademark. The result is a multifaceted jewel of a book: a hilarious romp; a painstaking dissection of middle-class mores; and a powerfully sympathetic portrait of a marriage in its death throes. It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry as we watch David forcing his kids to give away their computers; drawing up schemes for the mass redistribution of wealth; and inviting his wife's most desolate patients round for a Sunday roast. But that's because How to Be Good manages to be both brutally truthful and full of hope. It won't outsell the Bible; but it's a lot funnier. --Matthew BaylisFrom Publishers WeeklyKate; a doctor; wife and mother; is in the midst of a difficult decision: whether to leave or stay with her bitter; sarcastic husband David (who proudly writes a local newspaper column called ""The Angriest Man in Holloway""). The long-term marriage has gone stale; but is it worth uprooting the children and the comfortable lifestyle? Then David meets a faith healer called Dr. Goodnews; and suddenly converts to an idealistic do-gooder: donating the children's computer to an orphanage; giving away the family's Sunday dinner to homeless people and inviting runaways to stay in the guest room (and convincing the neighbors to do likewise). Barber gives an outstanding performance as Kate; humorously conveying her mounting irritation at having her money and belongings donated to strangers; her guilt at not feeling more generous and her hilarious desire for revenge. Barber brilliantly portrays each eccentric character: hippie-ish Goodnews; crusading David; petulant children and; poignantly; the hesitant; halting Barmy Brian; a mentally deficient patient of Kate's who needs looking after. Barber's stellar performance turns a worthy novel into a must-listen event.

9780375758260,When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management,With a new Afterword addressing todayâ€™s financial crisisA BUSINESS WEEK BEST BOOK OF THE YEARIn this business classicâ€”now with a new Afterword in which the author draws parallels to the recent financial crisisâ€”Roger Lowenstein captures the gripping roller-coaster ride of Long-Term Capital Management. Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players; Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Termâ€™s partners; the arrogance of their mathematical certainties; and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall.When it was founded in 1993; Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut; it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Termâ€™s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street; from Lehman Brothers to AIG; a decade later. In his new Afterword; Lowenstein shows that LTCMâ€™s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instabilityâ€”and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored.,English,UK,264,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435292091l/10669.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Roger Lowenstein,Economics|Finance|Business|Nonfiction|Economics|History

A gentle; solitary man; he finds solace and purpose in the sweetness of the apples; apricots; and plums he grows; and in the quiet; beating heart of the land--the valley of yellow grass bordering a deep canyon that has been his home since he was nine years old. Everything he is and has known is tied to this patch of earth. It is where his widowed mother is buried; taken by illness when he was just thirteen; and where his only companion; his beloved teenaged sister Elsbeth; mysteriously disappeared. It is where the horse wranglers--native men; mostly Nez Perce--pass through each spring with their wild herds; setting up camp in the flowering meadows between the trees.One day; while in town to sell his fruit at the market; two girls; barefoot and dirty; steal some apples. Later; they appear on his homestead; cautious yet curious about the man who gave them no chase. Feral; scared; and very pregnant; Jane and her sister Della take up on Talmadage's land and indulge in his deep reservoir of compassion. Yet just as the girls begin to trust him; brutal men with guns arrive in the orchard; and the shattering tragedy that follows sets Talmadge on an irrevocable course not only to save and protect them; putting himself between the girls and the world; but to reconcile the ghosts of his own troubled past.Writing with breathtaking precision and empathy; Amanda Coplin has crafted an astonishing debut novel about a man who disrupts the lonely harmony of an ordered life when he opens his heart and lets the world in.

9780061351430,Slash,From one of the greatest rock guitarists of our era comes a memoir that redefines sex; drugs; and rock 'n' rollHe was born in England but reared in L.A.; surrounded by the leading artists of the day amidst the vibrant hotbed of music and culture that was the early seventies. Slash spent his adolescence on the streets of Hollywood; discovering drugs; drinking; rock music; and girls; all while achieving notable status as a BMX rider. But everything changed in his world the day he first held the beat-up one-string guitar his grandmother had discarded in a closet.The instrument became his voice and it triggered a lifelong passion that made everything else irrelevant. As soon as he could string chords and a solo together; Slash wanted to be in a band and sought out friends with similar interests. His closest friend; Steven Adler; proved to be a conspirator for the long haul. As hairmetal bands exploded onto the L.A. scene and topped the charts; Slash sought his niche and a band that suited his raw and gritty sensibility.He found salvation in the form of four young men of equal mind: Axl Rose; Izzy Stradlin; Steven Adler; and Duff McKagan. Together they became Guns N' Roses; one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands of all time. Dirty; volatile; and as authentic as the streets that weaned them; they fought their way to the top with groundbreaking albums such as the iconicÂ Appetite for DestructionÂ andÂ Use Your Illusion IÂ andÂ II.Here; for the first time ever; Slash tells the tale that has yet to be told from the inside: how the band came together; how they wrote the music that defined an era; how they survived insane; never-ending tours; how they survived themselves; and; ultimately; how it all fell apart. This is a window onto the world of the notoriously private guitarist and a seat on the roller-coaster ride that was one of history's greatest rock 'n' roll machines; always on the edge of self-destruction; even at the pinnacle of its success. This is a candid recollection and reflection of Slash's friendships past and present; from easygoing Izzy to ever-steady Duff to wild-child Steven and complicated Axl.It is also an intensely personal account of struggle and triumph: as Guns N' Roses journeyed to the top; Slash battled his demons; escaping the overwhelming reality with women; heroin; coke; crack; vodka; and whatever else came along.He survived it all: lawsuits; rehab; riots; notoriety; debauchery; and destruction; and ultimately found his creative evolution. From Slash's Snakepit to his current band; the massively successful Velvet Revolver;Slash found an even keel by sticking to his guns.SlashÂ is everything the man; the myth; the legend; inspires: it's funny; honest; inspiring; jaw-dropping . . . and; in a word; excessive.,English,UK,458,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347554088l/1970449.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1970-02-01,Slash|Anthony Bozza,Music|Nonfiction|Biography|Biography|Autobiography

9780670022200,Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention,Selected by The New York Times Book Review as a Notable Book of the Year Years in the making-the definitive biography of the legendary black activist.  Of the great figure in twentieth-century American history perhaps none is more complex and controversial than Malcolm X. Constantly rewriting his own story; he became a criminal; a minister; a leader; and an icon; all before being felled by assassins' bullets at age thirty-nine. Through his tireless work and countless speeches he empowered hundreds of thousands of black Americans to create better lives and stronger communities while establishing the template for the self-actualized; independent African American man. In death he became a broad symbol of both resistance and reconciliation for millions around the world. Manning Marable's new biography of Malcolm is a stunning achievement. Filled with new information and shocking revelations that go beyond the Autobiography; Malcolm X unfolds a sweeping story of race and class in America; from the rise of Marcus Garvey and the Ku Klux Klan to the struggles of the civil rights movement in the fifties and sixties. Reaching into Malcolm's troubled youth; it traces a path from his parents' activism through his own engagement with the Nation of Islam; charting his astronomical rise in the world of Black Nationalism and culminating in the never-before-told true story of his assassination. Malcolm X will stand as the definitive work on one of the most singular forces for social change; capturing with revelatory clarity a man who constantly strove; in the great American tradition; to remake himself anew.,English,USA,608,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347690389l/7940589.jpg,Harper Collins,1970-02-01,Manning Marable,Biography|Nonfiction|History|Politics|Cultural|African American|Race

9780812993010,Creativity; Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration,â€œWhat does it mean to manage well?â€From Ed Catmull; co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios; comes an incisive book about creativity in businessâ€”sure to appeal to readers of Daniel Pink; Tom Peters; and Chip and Dan Heath. Creativity; Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights; a manual for anyone who strives for originality; and the first-ever; all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animationâ€”into the meetings; postmortems; and â€œBraintrustâ€sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is; at heart; a book about how to build a creative cultureâ€”but it is also; as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes; â€œan expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.â€For nearly twenty years; Pixar has dominated the world of animation; producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy; Monsters; Inc.; Finding Nemo; The Incredibles; Up; and WALL-E; which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling; the inventive plots; the emotional authenticity: In some ways; Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here; in this book; Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admiredâ€”and so profitable. Â  As a young man; Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah; where many computer science pioneers got their start; and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led; indirectly; to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later; Toy Story was released; changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movieâ€™s successâ€”and in the thirteen movies that followedâ€”was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar; based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention; such as: Â  â€Give a good idea to a mediocre team; and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team; and they will either fix it or come up with something better. â€If you donâ€™t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature; you will be ill prepared to lead.  â€Itâ€™s not the managerâ€™s job to prevent risks. Itâ€™s the managerâ€™s job to make it safe for others to take them. â€The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.  â€A companyâ€™s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody. â€Do not assume that general agreement will lead to changeâ€”it takes substantial energy to move a group; even when all are on board.,English,USA,340,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400863577l/18077903.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,Ed Catmull|Amy    Wallace,Business|Nonfiction|Leadership|Business|Management

In this brilliant; witty; and accessible book; renowned Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert describes the foibles of imagination and illusions of foresight that cause each of us to misconceive our tomorrows and misestimate our satisfactions. Vividly bringing to life the latest scientific research in psychology; cognitive neuroscience; philosophy; and behavioral economics; Gilbert reveals what scientists have discovered about the uniquely human ability to imagine the future; and about our capacity to predict how much we will like it when we get there.

9780553418840,The Book of Strange New Things,"A monumental; genre-defying novel over ten years in the making; Michel Faber's The Book of Strange New Things is a masterwork from a writer in full command of his many talents.It begins with Peter; a devoted man of faith; as he is called to the mission of a lifetime; one that takes him galaxies away from his wife; Bea. Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment; overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter's teachingsâ€”his Bible is their ""book of strange new things."" But Peter is rattled when Bea's letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries; and governments are crumbling. Bea's faith; once the guiding light of their lives; begins to falter. Suddenly; a separation measured by an otherworldly distance; and defined both by one newly discovered world and another in a state of collapse; is threatened by an ever-widening gulf that is much less quantifiable. While Peter is reconciling the needs of his congregation with the desires of his strange employer; Bea is struggling for survival. Their trials lay bare a profound meditation on faith; love tested beyond endurance; and our responsibility to those closest to us. Marked by the same bravura storytelling and precise language that made The Crimson Petal and the White such an international success; The Book of Strange New Things is extraordinary; mesmerizing; and replete with emotional complexity and genuine pathos.",English,USA,500,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1394824754l/20697435.jpg,Penguin,1988-01-01,Michel Faber,Fiction|Science Fiction|Religion|Fantasy

9781400065590,Kabul Beauty School: An American Woman Goes Behind the Veil,Soon after the fall of the Taliban; in 2001; Deborah Rodriguez went to Afghanistan as part of a group offering humanitarian aid to this war-torn nation. Surrounded by men and women whose skillsâ€“as doctors; nurses; and therapistsâ€“seemed eminently more practical than her own; Rodriguez; a hairdresser and mother of two from Michigan; despaired of being of any real use. Yet she soon found she had a gift for befriending Afghans; and once her profession became known she was eagerly sought out by Westerners desperate for a good haircut and by Afghan women; who have a long and proud tradition of running their own beauty salons. Thus an idea was born. With the help of corporate and international sponsors; the Kabul Beauty School welcomed its first class in 2003. Well meaning but sometimes brazen; Rodriguez stumbled through language barriers; overstepped cultural customs; and constantly juggled the challenges of a postwar nation even as she learned how to empower her students to become their familiesâ€breadwinners by learning the fundamentals of coloring techniques; haircutting; and makeup.Yet within the small haven of the beauty school; the line between teacher and student quickly blurred as these vibrant women shared with Rodriguez their stories and their hearts: the newlywed who faked her virginity on her wedding night; the twelve-year-old bride sold into marriage to pay her familyâ€™s debts; the Taliban memberâ€™s wife who pursued her training despite her husbandâ€™s constant beatings. Through these and other stories; Rodriguez found the strength to leave her own unhealthy marriage and allow herself to love again; Afghan style.With warmth and humor; Rodriguez details the lushness of a seemingly desolate region and reveals the magnificence behind the burqa. Kabul Beauty School is a remarkable tale of an extraordinary community of women who come together and learn the arts of perms; friendship; and freedom.From the Hardcover edition.,English,UK,288,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320448527l/316558.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Deborah Rodriguez,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography
9780345518510,Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin,"Official Book Club Selection is Kathy Griffin unplugged; uncensored; and unafraid to dish about what really happens on the road; away from the cameras; and at the star party after the show. (It's also her big chance to score that coveted book club endorsement she's always wanted. Are you there; Oprah? It's me; Kathy.)Kathy Griffin has won Emmys for her reality show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List; been nominated for a Grammy; worked and walked every red carpet known to man; and rung in the New Year with Anderson Cooper. But the legions of fans who pack Kathy's sold-out comedy shows have heard only part of her remarkable story. Writing with her trademark wit; the feisty comic settles a few old scores; celebrates the friends and mentors who helped her claw her way to the top; and shares insider gossip about celebrity behaviorâ€“the good; the bad; and the very ugly. She recounts the crazy ups and downs of her own career and introduces us to some of the supertalented people she encountered before they got famous (or; in some cases; after fame went to their heads). Word to the wise: If you've ever crossed Kathy Griffin at some point in your life; check the index for your name.Along the way; Kathy reveals intimate details about her life before and after she made the big time. She opens up about everything from growing up with a dysfunctional family in suburban Illinois to bombing as a young comedian in L.A.; from her well-publicized plastic surgery disasters to her highly publicized divorce; and more. Only in this book will you learn how the dinner table is the best training ground for a career in stand-up; how speaking your mind can bite you on the ass and buy you a house; and which people in Kathy's life have taught her the most valuable lessonsâ€“both inside and outside the entertainment industry. And as if all that wasn't enough; there are also dozens of exclusive and somewhat embarrassing photos from Kathy's own collectionâ€“featuring the diva of the D List herself; with her old nose as well as her new one; plus celebrity friends; foes; frenemies; and hangers-on for you to gawk at.Refreshingly candid; unflinchingly honest; and full of hilarious ""Did she really say that?"" moments; Official Book Club Selection will make you laugh until you cry; or just puke up a little bit.",English,UK,348,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428806540l/6534932.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Kathy Griffin,Humor|Comedy|Audiobook|Biography Memoir|Humor|Funny
9780571198770,Wit,Winner of the Pulitzer Prize; the New York Drama Critics Circle Award; the Drama Desk Award; the Outer Critics Circle Award; the Lucille Lortel Award; and the Oppenheimer AwardMargaret Edsonâ€™s powerfully imagined Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning play examines what makes life worth living through her exploration of one of existenceâ€™s unifying experiencesâ€”mortalityâ€”while she also probes the vital importance of human relationships. What we as her audience take away from this remarkable drama is a keener sense that; while death is real and unavoidable; our lives are ours to cherish or throw awayâ€”a lesson that can be both uplifting and redemptive. As the playwright herself puts it; â€œThe play is not about doctors or even about cancer. Itâ€™s about kindness; but it shows arrogance. Itâ€™s about compassion; but it shows insensitivity.â€In Wit; Edson delves into timeless questions with no final answers: How should we live our lives knowing that we will die? Is the way we live our lives and interact with others more important than what we achieve materially; professionally; or intellectually? How does language figure into our lives? Can science and art help us conquer death; or our fear of it? What will seem most important to each of us about life as that life comes to an end?The immediacy of the presentation; and the clarity and elegance of Edsonâ€™s writing; make this sophisticated; multilayered play accessible to almost any interested reader. As the play begins; Vivian Bearing; a renowned professor of English who has spent years studying and teaching the intricate; difficult Holy Sonnets of the seventeenth-century poet John Donne; is diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer. Confident of her ability to stay in control of events; she brings to her illness the same intensely rational and painstakingly methodical approach that has guided her stellar academic career. But as her disease and its excruciatingly painful treatment inexorably progress; she begins to question the single-minded values and standards that have always directed her; finally coming to understand the aspects of life that make it truly worth living. ,English,USA,85,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327908183l/171201.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,Margaret Edson,Plays|Drama|Fiction|Plays|Theatre|Academic|School|Health|Medicine|Contemporary|Classics|Womens|Death

9780060838590,Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded,The bestselling author of The Professor and the Madman and The Map That Changed the World examines the enduring and world-changing effects of the catastrophic eruption off the coast of Java of the earth's most dangerous volcano â€Krakatoa. The legendary annihilation in 1883 of the volcano-island of Krakatoa â€the name has since become a byword for a cataclysmic disaster â€was followed by an immense tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. Beyond the purely physical horrors of an event that has only very recently been properly understood; the eruption changed the world in more ways than could possibly be imagined. Dust swirled round the planet for years; causing temperatures to plummet and sunsets to turn vivid with lurid and unsettling displays of light. The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in BogotÃ¡ and Washington; D.C.; went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island's destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away. Most significant of all â€in view of today's new political climate â€the eruption helped to trigger in Java a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims: one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere. Simon Winchester's long experience in the world wandering as well as his knowledge of history and geology give us an entirely new perspective on this fascinating and iconic event as he brings it telling back to life.,English,USA,464,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407108467l/25017.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1988-01-01,Simon Winchester,History|Nonfiction|Science|Science|Geology|Environment|Nature
9781451624460,A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing,WHERE DID THE UNIVERSE COME FROM? WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE IT? WHAT WILL THE FUTURE BRING? AND FINALLY; WHY IS THERE SOMETHING RATHER THAN NOTHING?Lawrence Krauss's provocative answers to these and other timeless questions in a wildly popular lecture now on YouTube have attracted almost a million viewers. The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God; and it&#8217;s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues; scientists have; however; historically focused on other; more pressing issues&#8212;such as figuring out how the universe actually functions; which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. Now; in a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens; pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture; Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing; with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing; and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing; something will always arise from nothing. With his characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear explanations; Krauss takes us back to the beginning of the beginning; presenting the most recent evidence for how our universe evolved&#8212;and the implications for how it&#8217;s going to end. It will provoke; challenge; and delight readers as it looks at the most basic underpinnings of existence in a whole new way. And this knowledge that our universe will be quite different in the future from today has profound implications and directly affects how we live in the present. As Richard Dawkins has described it: This could potentially be the most important scientific book with implications for supernaturalism since Darwin. A fascinating antidote to outmoded philosophical and religious thinking; A Universe from Nothing is a provocative; game-changing entry into the debate about the existence of God and everything that exists. &#8220;Forget Jesus;&#8221; Krauss has argued; &#8220;the stars died so you could be born.&#8221;,English,USA,204,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1365217267l/11337189.jpg,Harper Collins,2002-01-02,Lawrence M.

9780375424040,The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives,In this irreverent and illuminating book; acclaimed writer and scientist Leonard Mlodinow shows us how randomness; chance; and probability reveal a tremendous amount about our daily lives; and how we misunderstand the significance of everything from a casual conversation to a major financial setback. As a result; successes and failures in life are often attributed to clear and obvious cases; when in actuality they are more profoundly influenced by chance.The rise and fall of your favorite movie star of the most reviled CEO--in fact; of all our destinies--reflects as much as planning and innate abilities. Even the legendary Roger Maris; who beat Babe Ruth's single-season home run record; was in all likelihood not great but just lucky. And it might be shocking to realize that you are twice as likely to be killed in a car accident on your way to buying a lottery ticket than you are to win the lottery.How could it have happened that a wine was given five out of five stars; the highest rating; in one journal and in another it was called the worst wine of the decade? Mlodinow vividly demonstrates how wine ratings; school grades; political polls; and many other things in daily life are less reliable than we believe. By showing us the true nature of change and revealing the psychological illusions that cause us to misjudge the world around us; Mlodinow gives fresh insight into what is really meaningful and how we can make decisions based on a deeper truth. From the classroom to the courtroom; from financial markets to supermarkets; from the doctor's office to the Oval Office; Mlodinow's insights will intrigue; awe; and inspire.Offering readers not only a tour of randomness; chance; and probability but also a new way of looking at the world; this original; unexpected journey reminds us that much in our lives is about as predictable as the steps of a stumbling man fresh from a night at the bar.,English,USA,252,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320392907l/2272880.jpg,Random House,1970-02-01,Leonard Mlodinow,Nonfiction|Science|Psychology|Science|Mathematics|Economics

After several lean and striving years; he has his pick of both magazine assignments and women: Juliet; the hotshot business reporter; Elisa; his gorgeous ex-girlfriend; now friend; and Hannah; ""almost universally regarded as nice and smart; or smart and nice;"" who holds her own in conversation with his friends.

The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. is a tale of one young man's search for happiness--and an inside look at how he really thinks about women; sex and love.",English,USA,256,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361026301l/16045140.jpg,Harper Collins,1970-02-01,Adelle Waldman,Fiction|Contemporary|Romance|Novels|Literary Fiction|New York|Abandoned|Adult Fiction|Adult|Literature

Alone and untethered; feeling lost in the country he had come to regard as home; Hans stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket; where he revisits his lost childhood and; thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon; begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country. Ramkissoon; a Gatsby-like figure who is part idealist and part operator; introduces Hans to an â€œotherâ€New York populated by immigrants and strivers of every race and nationality. Hans is alternately seduced and instructed by Chuckâ€™s particular brand of naivete and chutzpah--by his ability to hold fast to a sense of American and human possibility in which Hans has come to lose faith. Netherland gives us both a flawlessly drawn picture of a little-known New York and a story of much larger; and brilliantly achieved ambition: the grand strangeness and fading promise of 21st century America from an outsiderâ€™s vantage point; and the complicated relationship between the American dream and the particular dreamers. Most immediately; though; it is the story of one man--of a marriage foundering and recuperating in its mystery and ordinariness; of the shallows and depths of male friendship; of mourning and memory. Joseph Oâ€™Neillâ€™s prose; in its conscientiousness and beauty; involves us utterly in the struggle for meaning that governs any single life.,English,USA,269,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344205853l/2615008.jpg,Crossley,1988-01-01,Joseph O'Neill,Fiction|Novels|New York|Contemporary|Literary Fiction

The result is the most authoritative and scientifically accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking place in medicine; computers; artificial intelligence; nanotechnology; energy production; and astronautics.In all likelihood; by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain sensors and; like magicians; move objects around with the power of our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout the environment; and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow us to access the world's information base or conjure up any image we desire in the blink of an eye.Meanwhile; cars will drive themselves using GPS; and if room-temperature superconductors are discovered; vehicles will effortlessly fly on a cushion of air; coasting on powerful magnetic fields and ushering in the age of magnetism.Using molecular medicine; scientists will be able to grow almost every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of tiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness; while rapid advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or maybe even reverse the aging process; allowing human life spans to increase dramatically.In space; radically new shipsâ€”needle-sized vessels using laser propulsionâ€”could replace the expensive chemical rockets of today and perhaps visit nearby stars. Advances in nanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator; which would propel humans hundreds of miles above the earth's atmosphere at the push of a button.But these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. Kaku also discusses emotional robots; antimatter rockets; X-ray vision; and the ability to create new life-forms; and he considers the development of the world economy. He addresses the key questions: Who are the winner and losers of the future? Who will have jobs; and which nations will prosper?All the while; Kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles; examining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to mature; how far they can advance; and what their ultimate limitations and hazards are.

He explains what the mind is; how it evolved; and how it allows us to see; think; feel; laugh; interact; enjoy the arts; and ponder the mysteries of life.

[Pinker] deserves the superlatives that are lavished on him.""Â  The arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates some unfashionable ideas; such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection; and challenges fashionable ones; such as that passionate emotions are irrational; that parents socialize their children; and that nature is good and modern society corrupting.

Based on twelve years of research; she argues that vulnerability is not weakness; but rather our clearest path to courage; engagement; and meaningful connection.

For millions of years; humans have been seeking out tribes; be they religious; ethnic; economic; political; or even musical (think of the Deadheads).

But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun; with the first heavier-than-air; powered machine carrying a pilot.Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?David McCullough; two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize; tells the surprising; profoundly American story of Wilbur and Orville Wright.Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success; they were men of exceptional courage and determination; and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity; much of which they attributed to their upbringing. The house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing; but there were books aplenty; supplied mainly by their preacher father; and they never stopped reading.When they worked together; no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education; little money and no contacts in high places; never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did; not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances; they risked being killed.In this thrilling book; master historian David McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers; including private diaries; notebooks; scrapbooks; and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers' story; including the little-known contributions of their sister; Katharine; without whom things might well have gone differently for them.,English,USA,320,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430942575l/22609391.jpg,Hachette,1970-02-01,David McCullough,History|Biography|Nonfiction|North American Hi...|American History

9781608190460,Mornings in Jenin,A heart-wrenching; powerfully written novel that could do for Palestine what The Kite Runner did for Afghanistan. Forcibly removed from the ancient village of Ein Hod by the newly formed state of Israel in 1948; the Abulhejas are moved into the Jenin refugee camp. There; exiled from his beloved olive groves; the family patriarch languishes of a broken heart; his eldest son fathers a family and falls victim to an Israeli bullet; and his grandchildren struggle against tragedy toward freedom; peace; and home. This is the Palestinian story; told as never before; through four generations of a single family. The very precariousness of existence in the camps quickens life itself. Amal; the patriarch's bright granddaughter; feels this with certainty when she discovers the joys of young friendship and first love and especially when she loses her adored father; who read to her daily as a young girl in the quiet of the early dawn. Through Amal we get the stories of her twin brothers; one who is kidnapped by an Israeli soldier and raised Jewish; the other who sacrifices everything for the Palestinian cause. Amalâ€™s own dramatic story threads between the major Palestinian-Israeli clashes of three decades; it is one of love and loss; of childhood; marriage; and parenthood; and finally of the need to share her history with her daughter; to preserve the greatest love she has.  The deep and moving humanity of Mornings in Jenin forces us to take a fresh look at one of the defining political conflicts of our lifetimes.,English,USA,352,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312020216l/6692041.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1970-02-01,Susan Abulhawa,Historical|Historical Fiction|Fiction
9780385539710,The Children Act,A fiercely intelligent; well-respected High Court judge in London faces a morally ambiguous case while her own marriage crumbles in a novel that will keep readers thoroughly enthralled until the last stunning page.Fiona Maye is a High Court judge in London presiding over cases in family court. She is fiercely intelligent; well respected; and deeply immersed in the nuances of her particular field of law. Often the outcome of a case seems simple from the outside; the course of action to ensure a child's welfare obvious. But the law requires more rigor than mere pragmatism; and Fiona is expert in considering the sensitivities of culture and religion when handing down her verdicts. But Fiona's professional success belies domestic strife. Her husband; Jack; asks her to consider an open marriage and; after an argument; moves out of their house. His departure leaves her adrift; wondering whether it was not love she had lost so much as a modern form of respectability; whether it was not contempt and ostracism she really fears. She decides to throw herself into her work; especially a complex case involving a seventeen-year-old boy whose parents will not permit a lifesaving blood transfusion because it conflicts with their beliefs as Jehovah's Witnesses. But Jack doesn't leave her thoughts; and the pressure to resolve the case - as well as her crumbling marriage - tests Fiona in ways that will keep readers thoroughly enthralled until the last stunning page.,English,UK,240,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405290619l/21965107.jpg,Crossley,2002-01-02,Ian McEwan,Fiction|Contemporary|Literary Fiction|European Literature|British Literature
9780679722010,The Selected Poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke,Parallel German text and English translation.The influence and popularity of Rilkeâ€™s poetry in America have never been greater than they are today; more than fifty years after his death. Rilke is unquestionably the most significant and compelling poet of romantic transformation; of spiritual quest; that the twentieth century has known. His poems of ecstatic identification with the world exert a seemingly endless fascination for contemporary readers.In Stephen Mitchellâ€™s versions; many readers feel that they have discovered an English rendering that captures the lyric intensity; fluency; and reach of Rilkeâ€™s poetry more accurately and convincingly than has ever been done before.Mr. Mitchell is impeccable in his adherence to Rilkeâ€™s text; to his formal music; and to the complexity of his thought; at the same time; his work has authority and power as poetry in its own right. Few translators of any poet have arrived at the delicate balance of fidelity and originality that Mr. Mitchell has brought off with seeming effortlessness.Originally published: New York : Random House; 1982.,English,UK,356,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343101334l/46201.jpg,Random House,1970-02-01,Rainer Maria Rilke|Stephen Mitchell|Robert Hass,Poetry|Classics|European Literature|German Literature|Literature|Fiction

9781416571770,The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris,"The Greater Journey is the enthralling; inspiring - and until now; untold - story of the adventurous American artists; writers; doctors; politicians; architects; and others of high aspiration who set off for Paris in the years between 1830 and 1900; ambitious to excel in their work.After risking the hazardous journey across the Atlantic; these Americans embarked on a greater journey in the City of Light. Most had never left home; never experienced a different culture. None had any guarantee of success. That they achieved so much for themselves and their country profoundly altered American history. As David McCullough writes; ""Not all pioneers went west."" Elizabeth Blackwell; the first female doctor in America; was one of this intrepid band. Another was Charles Sumner; who enrolled at the Sorbonne because of a burning desire to know more about everything. There he saw black students with the same ambition he had; and when he returned home; he would become the most powerful; unyielding voice for abolition in the U.S. Senate; almost at the cost of his life. Two staunch friends; James Fenimore Cooper and Samuel F. B. Morse; worked unrelentingly every day in Paris; Cooper writing and Morse painting what would be his masterpiece. From something he saw in France; Morse would also bring home his momentous idea for the telegraph. Pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk from New Orleans launched his spectacular career performing in Paris at age 15. George P. A. Healy; who had almost no money and little education; took the gamble of a lifetime and with no prospects whatsoever in Paris became one of the most celebrated portrait painters of the day. His subjects included Abraham Lincoln. Medical student Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote home of his toil and the exhilaration in ""being at the center of things"" in what was then the medical capital of the world. From all they learned in Paris; Holmes and his fellow ""medicals"" were to exert lasting influence on the profession of medicine in the United States. Writers Ralph Waldo Emerson; Nathaniel Hawthorne; Mark Twain; and Henry James were all ""discovering"" Paris; marveling at the treasures in the Louvre; or out with the Sunday throngs strolling the city's boulevards and gardens. ""At last I have come into a dreamland;"" wrote Harriet Beecher Stowe; seeking escape from the notoriety Uncle Tom's Cabin had brought her. Almost forgotten today; the heroic American ambassador Elihu Washburne bravely remained at his post through the Franco-Prussian War; the long Siege of Paris and even more atrocious nightmare of the Commune. His vivid account in his diary of the starvation and suffering endured by the people of Paris (drawn on here for the first time) is one readers will never forget. The genius of sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens; the son of an immigrant shoemaker; and of painters Mary Cassatt and John Singer Sargent; three of the greatest American artists ever; would flourish in Paris; inspired by the examples of brilliant French masters; and by Paris itself. Nearly all of these Americans; whatever their troubles learning French; their spells of homesickness; and their suffering in the raw cold winters by the Seine; spent many of the happiest days and nights of their lives in Paris. McCullough tells this sweeping; fascinating story with power and intimacy; bringing us into the lives of remarkable men and women who; in Saint-Gaudens's phrase; longed ""to soar into the blue.""

9780374105980,The Hare With Amber Eyes: A Family's Century of Art and Loss,The Ephrussis were a grand banking family; as rich and respected as the Rothschilds; who â€œburned like a cometâ€in nineteenth-century Paris and Vienna society. Yet by the end of World War II; almost the only thing remaining of their vast empire was a collection of 264 wood and ivory carvings; none of them larger than a matchbox.The renowned ceramicist Edmund de Waal became the fifth generation to inherit this small and exquisite collection of netsuke. Entranced by their beauty and mystery; he determined to trace the story of his family through the story of the collection.The netsukeâ€”drunken monks; almost-ripe plums; snarling tigersâ€”were gathered by Charles Ephrussi at the height of the Parisian rage for all things Japanese. Charles had shunned the place set aside for him in the family business to make a study of art; and of beautiful living. An early supporter of the Impressionists; he appears; oddly formal in a top hat; in Renoirâ€™s Luncheon of the Boating Party. Marcel Proust studied Charles closely enough to use him as a model for the aesthete and lover Swann in Remembrance of Things Past.Charles gave the carvings as a wedding gift to his cousin Viktor in Vienna; his children were allowed to play with one netsuke each while they watched their mother; the Baroness Emmy; dress for ball after ball. Her older daughter grew up to disdain fashionable society. Longing to write; she struck up a correspondence with Rilke; who encouraged her in her poetry.The Anschluss changed their world beyond recognition. Ephrussi and his cosmopolitan family were imprisoned or scattered; and Hitlerâ€™s theorist on the â€œJewish questionâ€appropriated their magnificent palace on the Ringstrasse. A library of priceless books and a collection of Old Master paintings were confiscated by the Nazis. But the netsuke were smuggled away by a loyal maid; Anna; and hidden in her straw mattress. Years after the war; she would find a way to return them to the family sheâ€™d served even in their exile.In The Hare with Amber Eyes; Edmund de Waal unfolds the story of a remarkable family and a tumultuous century. Sweeping yet intimate; it is a highly original meditation on art; history; and family; as elegant and precise as the netsuke themselves.,English,USA,368,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316730175l/7821828.jpg,Harper Collins,2010-05-05,Edmund de Waal,Nonfiction|History|Biography|Art|Autobiography|Memoir|Cultural|Japan|Historical|Abandoned|Biography Memoir|Cultural|France

9780618620110,How We Decide,The first book to use the unexpected discoveries of neuroscience to help us make the best decisions.Since Plato; philosophers have described the decision-making process as either rational or emotional: we carefully deliberate; or we â€œblinkâ€and go with our gut. But as scientists break open the mindâ€™s black box with the latest tools of neuroscience; theyâ€™re discovering that this is not how the mind works. Our best decisions are a finely tuned blend of both feeling and reasonâ€”and the precise mix depends on the situation. When buying a house; for example; itâ€™s best to let our unconscious mull over the many variables. But when weâ€™re picking a stock; intuition often leads us astray. The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain; and to do this; we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need; drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of â€œdecidersâ€â€”from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.Lehrer shows how people are taking advantage of the new science to make better television shows; win more football games; and improve military intelligence. His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone; from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better?,English,UK,259,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1382946716l/3860977.jpg,Random House,1970-02-01,Jonah Lehrer,Nonfiction|Psychology|Science|Business|Biology|Neuroscience|Self Help
9780743258070,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,"Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder; from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings; he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography; we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life; Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours.He was; during his 84-year life; America's best scientist; inventor; diplomat; writer; and business strategist; and he was also one of its most practicalâ€”though not most profoundâ€”political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity; and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances; local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union; the Declaration of Independence; the treaty of alliance with France; the peace treaty with England; and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor; democratic values; and philosophical pragmatism.But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented; and continually reinvented; was himself. America's first great publicist; he was; in his life and in his writings; consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process; he carefully crafted his own persona; portrayed it in public; and polished it for posterity.Through it all; he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength; not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully; and none so intuitively.In this colorful and intimate narrative; Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life; from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman; scientist; and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson; his practical marriage; and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.",English,USA,586,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1397772877l/10883.jpg,Hachette,1970-02-01,Walter Isaacson,Biography|History|Nonfiction|North American Hi...|American History|Biography Memoir

9780307887890,The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses,"Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe; changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing; it relies on ""validated learning;"" rapid scientific experimentation; as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles; measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics; and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility; altering plans inch by inch; minute by minute.Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans; The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously; to adapt and adjust before it's too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.",English,USA,299,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333576876l/10127019.jpg,Harper Collins,1970-02-01,Eric Ries,Business|Nonfiction|Business|Entrepreneurship|Business|Management

9780375758230,Paris to the Moon,"With singular wit and insight; Gopnik weaves the magical with the mundane in a wholly delightful; often hilarious look at what it was to be an American family man in Paris at the end of the twentieth century.Paris. The name alone conjures images of chestnut-lined boulevards; sidewalk cafÃ©s; breathtaking faÃ§ades around every corner--in short; an exquisite romanticism that has captured the American imagination for as long as there have been Americans.In 1995; Adam Gopnik; his wife; and their infant son left the familiar comforts and hassles of New York City for the urbane glamour of the City of Light. Gopnik is a longtime New Yorker writer; and the magazine has sent its writers to Paris for decades--but his was above all a personal pilgrimage to the place that had for so long been the undisputed capital of everything cultural and beautiful. It was also the opportunity to raise a child who would know what it was to romp in the Luxembourg Gardens; to enjoy a croque monsieur in a Left Bank cafÃ©--a child (and perhaps a father; too) who would have a grasp of that Parisian sense of style we Americans find so elusive.So; in the grand tradition of the American abroad; Gopnik walked the paths of the Tuileries; enjoyed philosophical discussions at his local bistro; wrote as violet twilight fell on the arrondissements. Of course; as readers of Gopnik's beloved and award-winning ""Paris Journals"" in The New Yorker know; there was also the matter of raising a child and carrying on with day-to-day; not-so-fabled life. Evenings with French intellectuals preceded middle-of-the-night baby feedings; afternoons were filled with trips to the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and pinball games; weekday leftovers were eaten while three-star chefs debated a ""culinary crisis.""As Gopnik describes in this funny and tender book; the dual processes of navigating a foreign city and becoming a parent are not completely dissimilar journeys--both hold new routines; new languages; a new set of rules by which everyday life is lived. With singular wit and insight; Gopnik weaves the magical with the mundane in a wholly delightful; often hilarious look at what it was to be an American family man in Paris at the end of the twentieth century. ""We went to Paris for a sentimental reeducation - I did anyway - even though the sentiments we were instructed in were not the ones we were expecting to learn; which I believe is why they call it an education.""",English,USA,368,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388345313l/7062.jpg,Macmillan,1970-02-01,Adam Gopnik,Travel|Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Cultural|France|Writing|Essays

9780192836180,On the Genealogy of Morals,On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) is a book about the history of ethics and about interpretation. Nietzsche rewrites the former as a history of cruelty; exposing the central values of the Judaeo-Christian and liberal traditions - compassion; equality; justice - as the product of a brutal process of conditioning designed to domesticate the animal vitality of earlier cultures. The result is a book which raises profoundly disquieting issues about the violence of both ethics and interpretation. Nietzsche questions moral certainties by showing that religion and science have no claim to absolute truth; before turning on his own arguments in order to call their very presuppositions into question. The Genealogy is the most sustained of Nietzsche's later works and offers one of the fullest expressions of his characteristic concerns.

9780393244660,Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,Four years after his #1 bestseller The Big Short; Michael Lewis returns to Wall Street to report on a high-tech predator stalking the equity markets.Flash Boys is about a small group of Wall Street guys who figure out that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for the benefit of insiders and that; postâ€“financial crisis; the markets have become not more free but less; and more controlled by the big Wall Street banks. Working at different firms; they come to this realization separately; but after they discover one another; the flash boys band together and set out to reform the financial markets. This they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency tradingâ€”source of the most intractable problemsâ€”will have no advantage whatsoever.The characters in Flash Boys are fabulous; each completely different from what you think of when you think â€œWall Street guy.â€Several have walked away from jobs in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars a year.

195170342,Washington's Crossing,Six months after the Declaration of Independence; the American Revolution was all but lost. A powerful British force had routed the Americans at New York; occupied three colonies; and advanced within sight of Philadelphia.Yet; as David Hackett Fischer recounts in this riveting history; George Washington--and many other Americans--refused to let the Revolution die. On Christmas night; as a howling nor'easter struck the Delaware Valley; he led his men across the river and attacked the exhausted Hessian garrison at Trenton; killing or capturing nearly a thousand men. A second battle of Trenton followed within days. The Americans held off a counterattack by Lord Cornwallis's best troops; then were almost trapped by the British force. Under cover of night; Washington's men stole behind the enemy and struck them again; defeating a brigade at Princeton. The British were badly shaken. In twelve weeks of winter fighting; their army suffered severe damage; their hold on New Jersey was broken; and their strategy was ruined.Fischer's richly textured narrative reveals the crucial role of contingency in these events. We see how the campaign unfolded in a sequence of difficult choices by many actors; from generals to civilians; on both sides. While British and German forces remained rigid and hierarchical; Americans evolved an open and flexible system that was fundamental to their success. The startling success of Washington and his compatriots not only saved the faltering American Revolution; but helped to give it new meaning.,English,UK,564,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353284022l/1206073.jpg,Crossley,2010-05-05,David Hackett Fischer,History|Nonfiction|North American Hi...|American History|Military History|American Revolution|Military|Military History|War

9781586483040,Auschwitz,"Auschwitz-Birkenau is the site of the largest mass murder in human history. Yet its story is not fully known. In Auschwitz; Laurence Rees reveals new insights from more than 100 original interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators who speak on the record for the first time. Their testimonies provide a portrait of the inner workings of the camp in unrivalled detailâ€”from the techniques of mass murder; to the politics and gossip mill that turned between guards and prisoners; to the on-camp brothel in which the lines between those guards and prisoners became surprisingly blurred.Rees examines the strategic decisions that led the Nazi leadership to prescribe Auschwitz as its primary site for the extinction of Europe's Jewsâ€”their ""Final Solution."" He concludes that many of the horrors that were perpetrated in Auschwitz were driven not just by ideological inevitability but as a ""practical"" response to a war in the East that had begun to go wrong for Germany. A terrible immoral pragmatism characterizes many of the decisions that determined what happened at Auschwitz. Thus the story of the camp becomes a morality tale; too; in which evil is shown to proceed in a series of deft; almost noiseless incremental steps until it produces the overwhelming horror of the industrial scale slaughter that was inflicted in the gas chambers of Auschwitz",English,USA,400,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387726300l/978098.jpg,Crossley,2010-05-05,Laurence Rees,History|Nonfiction|World War II|Holocaust|War|World War II|War

In The Invisible Gorilla; Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons; creators of one of psychologyâ€™s most famous experiments; use remarkable stories and counterintuitive scientific findings to demonstrate an important truth: Our minds donâ€™t work the way we think they do. We think we see ourselves and the world as they really are; but weâ€™re actually missing a whole lot.Again and again; we think we experience and understand the world as it is; but our thoughts are beset by everyday illusions. We write traffic laws and build criminal cases on the assumption that people will notice when something unusual happens right in front of them. Weâ€™re sure we know where we were on 9/11; falsely believing that vivid memories are seared into our minds with perfect fidelity. And as a society; we spend billions on devices to train our brains because weâ€™re continually tempted by the lure of quick fixes and effortless self-improvement. Â The Invisible Gorilla reveals the myriad ways that our intuitions can deceive us; but itâ€™s much more than a catalog of human failings. Chabris and Simons explain why we succumb to these everyday illusions and what we can do to inoculate ourselves against their effects. Ultimately; the book provides a kind of x-ray vision into our own minds; making it possible to pierce the veil of illusions that clouds our thoughts and to think clearly for perhaps the first time.Â ,English,USA,320,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320530790l/7783191.jpg,Macmillan,1970-02-01,Christopher Chabris|Daniel Simons,Psychology|Nonfiction|Science|Business

Like Safe Area Gorazde; Palestine has been favorably compared to Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus for its ability to brilliantly navigate such socially and politically sensitive subject matter within the confines of the comic book medium.Sacco has often been called the first comic book journalist; and he is certainly the best.

9780375705240,Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation,"Informs our understanding of American politics--then and now--and gives us a new perspective on the unpredictable forces that shape history.An illuminating study of the intertwined lives of the founders of the American republic--John Adams; Aaron Burr; Benjamin Franklin; Alexander Hamilton; Thomas Jefferson; James Madison; and George Washington.During the 1790s; which Ellis calls the most decisive decade in our nation's history; the greatest statesmen of their generation--and perhaps any--came together to define the new republic and direct its course for the coming centuries. Ellis focuses on six discrete moments that exemplify the most crucial issues facing the fragile new nation: Burr and Hamilton's deadly duel; and what may have really happened; Hamilton; Jefferson; and Madison's secret dinner; during which the seat of the permanent capital was determined in exchange for passage of Hamilton's financial plan; Franklin's petition to end the ""peculiar institution"" of slavery--his last public act--and Madison's efforts to quash it; Washington's precedent-setting Farewell Address; announcing his retirement from public office and offering his country some final advice; Adams's difficult term as Washington's successor and his alleged scheme to pass the presidency on to his son; and finally; Adams and Jefferson's renewed correspondence at the end of their lives; in which they compared their different views of the Revolution and its legacy.In a lively and engaging narrative; Ellis recounts the sometimes collaborative; sometimes archly antagonistic interactions between these men; and shows us the private characters behind the public personas: Adams; the ever-combative iconoclast; whose closest political collaborator was his wife; Abigail; Burr; crafty; smooth; and one of the most despised public figures of his time; Hamilton; whose audacious manner and deep economic savvy masked his humble origins; Jefferson; renowned for his eloquence; but so reclusive and taciturn that he rarely spoke more than a few sentences in public; Madison; small; sickly; and paralyzingly shy; yet one of the most effective debaters of his generation; and the stiffly formal Washington; the ultimate realist; larger-than-life; and America's only truly indispensable figure.Ellis argues that the checks and balances that permitted the infant American republic to endure were not primarily legal; constitutional; or institutional; but intensely personal; rooted in the dynamic interaction of leaders with quite different visions and values. Revisiting the old-fashioned idea that character matters; Founding Brothers informs our understanding of American politics--then and now--and gives us a new perspective on the unpredictable forces that shape history.",English,USA,290,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388791106l/7493.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Joseph J.

The stranger claims to be the child of a lost Mughal princess; the youngest sister of Akbar's grandfather Babar: Qara Koz; 'Lady Black Eyes'; a great beauty believed to possess powers of enchantment and sorcery; who is taken captive first by an Uzbek warlord; then by the Shah of Persia; and finally becomes the lover of a certain Argalia; a Florentine soldier of fortune; commander of the armies of the Ottoman Sultan. When Argalia returns home with his Mughal mistress the city is mesmerized by her presence; and much trouble ensues. The Enchantress of Florence is the story of a woman attempting to command her own destiny in a man's world. It brings together two cities that barely know each other - the hedonistic Mughal capital; in which the brilliant emperor wrestles daily with questions of belief; desire and the treachery of sons; and the equally sensual Florentine world of powerful courtesans; humanist philosophy and inhuman torture; where Argalia's boyhood friend ""il Machia"" - Niccolo' Machiavelli - is learning; the hard way; about the true brutality of power. These two worlds; so far apart; turn out to be uncannily alike; and the enchantments of women hold sway over them both. But is Mogor's story true? And if so; then what happened to the lost princess?

A studious; law-abiding; intense youngster from Newark; New Jersey; Marcus Messner; is beginning his sophomore year on the pastoral; conservative campus of Ohioâ€™s Winesburg College.

Because his father; the sturdy; hard-working neighborhood butcher; seems to have gone mad -- mad with fear and apprehension of the dangers of adult life; the dangers of the world; the dangers he sees in every corner for his beloved boy.As the long-suffering; desperately harassed mother tells her son; the fatherâ€™s fear arises from love and pride.

Ranging from his absurdist side (Message from a Cockroach; TV News: The Death of Humpty Dumpty; Tips for Serial Killers) to his unerring ear for American speech (Politician Talk; Societal Clichs; Euphemisms: 13 sections) to his unsparing views on America and its values (War; God; Stuff Like That; Zero Tolerance; Tired of the Handi-crap); Carlin delivers everything that his fans expect; and then adds a few surprises.

9780316001920,Cleopatra: A Life,The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer brings to life the most intriguing woman in the history of the world: Cleopatra; the last queen of Egypt.Her palace shimmered with onyx; garnet; and gold; but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else; Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator. Though her life spanned fewer than forty years; it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice; each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen; however; to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony; among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and--after his murder--three more with his protÃ©gÃ©. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire; in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since.Famous long before she was notorious; Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo; Tiepolo; and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way; Cleopatra's supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a masterly return to the classical sources; Stacy Schiff here boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order. Rich in detail; epic in scope; Schiff's is a luminous; deeply original reconstruction of a dazzling life.,English,USA,302,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1294098301l/7968243.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1970-02-01,Stacy Schiff,Biography|History|Nonfiction|Historical

9781451683400,Free Will,Belief in free will touches nearly everything that human beings value. It is difficult to think about law; politics; religion; public policy; intimate relationships; moralityâ€”as well as feelings of remorse or personal achievementâ€”without first imagining that every person is the true source of his or her thoughts and actions. And yet the facts tell us that free will is an illusion.In this enlightening book; Sam Harris argues that this truth about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom; but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.,English,USA,83,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1532072045l/13259270.jpg,Harper Collins,1988-01-01,Sam Harris,Philosophy|Nonfiction|Science|Psychology|Religion|Biology|Neuroscience

9780786865060,Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain,"The art of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was all about his private life; but written in a code as obscure as T.S. Eliot's. Now Charles Cross has cracked the code in the definitive biography Heavier Than Heaven; an all-access pass to Cobain's heart and mind. It reveals many secrets; thanks to 400-plus interviews; and even quotes Cobain's diaries and suicide notes and reveals an unreleased Nirvana masterpiece. At last we know how he created; how lies helped him die; how his family and love life entwined his art--plus; what the heck ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" really means. (It was graffiti by Bikini Kill's Kathleen Hanna after a double date with Dave Grohl; Cobain; and the ""over-bored and self-assured"" Tobi Vail; who wore Teen Spirit perfume; Hanna wrote it to taunt the emotionally clingy Cobain for wearing Vail's scent after sex--a violation of the no-strings-attached dating ethos of the Olympia; Washington; ""outcast teen"" underground. Cobain's stomach-churning passion for Vail erupted in six or so hit tunes like ""Aneurysm"" and ""Drain You."")  Cross uncovers plenty of news; mostly grim and gripping. As a teen; Cobain said he had ""suicide genes;"" and his clan was peculiarly defiant: one of his suicidal relatives stabbed his own belly in front of his family; then ripped apart the wound in the hospital. Cobain was contradictory: a sweet; popular teen athlete and sinister berserker; a kid who rescued injured pigeons and laughingly killed a cat; a talented yet astoundingly morbid visual artist. He grew up to be a millionaire who slept in cars (and stole one); a fiercely loyal man who ruthlessly screwed his oldest; best friends. In fact; his essence was contradictions barely contained. Cross; the coauthor of Nevermind: Nirvana; the definitive book about the making of the classic album; puts numerous Cobain-generated myths to rest. (Cobain never lived under a bridge--that Aberdeen bridge immortalized in the 12th song on Nevermind was a tidal slough; so nobody could sleep under it.) He gives the fullest account yet of what it was like to be; or love; Kurt Cobain. Heavier Than Heaven outshines the also indispensable Come As You Are. It's the deepest book about pop's darkest falling star. --Tim Appelo",English,USA,381,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348289083l/1149440.jpg,Crossley,1988-01-01,Charles R.

9780802714630,Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time,"Anyone alive in the eighteenth century would have known that ""the longitude problem"" was the thorniest scientific dilemma of the dayâ€”and had been for centuries. Lacking the ability to measure their longitude; sailors throughout the great ages of exploration had been literally lost at sea as soon as they lost sight of land. Thousands of lives; and the increasing fortunes of nations; hung on a resolution.The scientific establishment of Europeâ€”from Galileo to Sir Issac Newtonâ€”had mapped the heavens in both hemispheres in its certain pursuit of a celestial answer. In stark contrast; one man; John Harrison; dared to imagine a mechanical solutionâ€”a clock that would keep precise time at sea; something no clock had ever been able to do on land. Longitude is a dramatic human story of an epic scientific quest and Harrison's forty-year obsession with building his perfect timekeeper; known today as the chronometer. Full of heroism and chicanery; it is also a fascinating brief history of astronomy; navigation; and clock-making; and opens a new window on our world.On its 10th anniversary; a gift edition of this classic book; with a forward by one of history's greatest explorers; and eight pages of color illustrations.",English,USA,192,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388462711l/4806.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Dava Sobel|Neil Armstrong,History|Nonfiction|Science|Biography|Historical

9780312347290,The World Without Us,A penetrating; page-turning tour of a post-human EarthIn The World Without Us; Alan Weisman offers an utterly original approach to questions of humanity's impact on the planet: he asks us to envision our Earth; without us.In this far-reaching narrative; Weisman explains how our massive infrastructure would collapse and finally vanish without human presence; which everyday items may become immortalized as fossils; how copper pipes and wiring would be crushed into mere seams of reddish rock; why some of our earliest buildings might be the last architecture left; and how plastic; bronze sculpture; radio waves; and some man-made molecules may be our most lasting gifts to the universe.The World Without Us reveals how; just days after humans disappear; floods in New York's subways would start eroding the city's foundations; and how; as the world's cities crumble; asphalt jungles would give way to real ones. It describes the distinct ways that organic and chemically treated farms would revert to wild; how billions more birds would flourish; and how cockroaches in unheated cities would perish without us. Drawing on the expertise of engineers; atmospheric scientists; art conservators; zoologists; oil refiners; marine biologists; astrophysicists; religious leaders from rabbis to the Dali Lama; and paleontologists---who describe a prehuman world inhabited by megafauna like giant sloths that stood taller than mammoths---Weisman illustrates what the planet might be like today; if not for us.From places already devoid of humans (a last fragment of primeval European forest; the Korean DMZ; Chernobyl); Weisman reveals Earth's tremendous capacity for self-healing. As he shows which human devastations are indelible; and which examples of our highest art and culture would endure longest; Weisman's narrative ultimately drives toward a radical but persuasive solution that needn't depend on our demise. It is narrative nonfiction at its finest; and in posing an irresistible concept with both gravity and a highly readable touch; it looks deeply at our effects on the planet in a way that no other book has.,English,USA,324,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441986417l/248787.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2010-05-05,Alan Weisman,Nonfiction|Science|Environment|Environment|Nature|History

Flying past towering pillars of smoke; parachuting down to the edge of an all-consuming blaze; shoveling and sawing for hours upon hours; days at a time; all to hold the line and push back against the raw power of Mother Nature.But there's also little else as thrilling - at least to Rowan Tripp. The Missoula smoke jumpers are one of the most exclusive fire-fighting squads in the nation; and the job is in Rowan's blood: her father is a legend in the field. She's been fighting fires since her eighteenth birthday. At this point; returning to the wilds of Montana for the season feels like coming home - even with reminders of the partner she lost last season still lingering in the air.Fortunately; this year's rookie crop is among the strongest ever - and Gulliver Curry's one of the best.

9781439192820,The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True,Magic takes many forms. Supernatural magic is what our ancestors used in order to explain the world before they developed the scientific method. The ancient Egyptians explained the night by suggesting the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. The Vikings believed a rainbow was the godsâ€bridge to earth. The Japanese used to explain earthquakes by conjuring a gigantic catfish that carried the world on its backâ€”earthquakes occurred each time it flipped its tail. These are magical; extraordinary tales. But there is another kind of magic; and it lies in the exhilaration of discovering the real answers to these questions. It is the magic of realityâ€”science.Packed with clever thought experiments; dazzling illustrations and jaw-dropping facts; The Magic of Reality explains a stunningly wide range of natural phenomena. What is stuff made of? How old is the universe? Why do the continents look like disconnected pieces of a puzzle? What causes tsunamis? Why are there so many kinds of plants and animals? Who was the first man; or woman? This is a page-turning; graphic detective story that not only mines all the sciences for its clues but primes the reader to think like a scientist as well.Richard Dawkins; the worldâ€™s most famous evolutionary biologist and one of science educationâ€™s most passionate advocates; has spent his career elucidating the wonders of science for adult readers. But now; in a dramatic departure; he has teamed up with acclaimed artist Dave McKean and used his unrivaled explanatory powers to share the magic of science with readers of all ages.

Who but Stephen King would turn a Port-O-San into a slimy birth canal; or a roadside honky-tonk into a place for endless love? A book salesman with a grievance might pick up a mute hitchhiker; not knowing the silent man in the passenger seat listens altogether too well. Or an exercise routine on a stationary bicycle; begun to reduce bad cholesterol; might take its rider on a captivatingâ€”and then terrifyingâ€”journey. Set on a remote key in Florida; â€œThe Gingerbread Girlâ€is a riveting tale featuring a young woman as vulnerableâ€”and resourcefulâ€”as Audrey Hepburnâ€™s character in Wait Until Dark. In â€œAyana;â€a blind girl works a miracle with a kiss and the touch of her hand.

In one of the longer stories here; â€œN.;â€which recently broke new ground when it was adapted as a graphic digital entertainment; a psychiatric patientâ€™s irrational thinking might create an apocalyptic threat in the Maine countryside...or keep the world from falling victim to it. Just After Sunsetâ€”call it dusk; call it twilight; itâ€™s a time when human intercourse takes on an unnatural cast; when the imagination begins to reach for shadows as they dissipate to darkness and living daylight can be scared right out of you.

9780143036490,The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History,At the height of WWI; historyâ€™s most lethal influenza virus erupted in an army camp in Kansas; moved east with American troops; then exploded; killing as many as 100 million people worldwide. It killed more people in twenty-four months than AIDS killed in twenty-four years; more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.

Commenting on artists such as Avedon; Clifford; Mapplethorpe; and Nadar; Roland Barthes presents photography as being outside the codes of language or culture; acting on the body as much as on the mind; and rendering death and loss more acutely than any other medium.

The Analects are a collection of Confucius' sayings; compiled by his pupils shortly after his death in 497 B.C.; and they reflect the extent to which Confucius held up a moral ideal for all men. The aim is the perfection of one's moral character; the method one of arduous pursuit of such moral attributes as benevolence; wisdom; courage; the result is no recompense either in this life or the next â€to follow the Way must be its own reward.

9780767915820,The Sociopath Next Door,"Who is the devil you know? Is it your lying; cheating ex-husband?Your sadistic high school gym teacher?Your boss who loves to humiliate people in meetings?The colleague who stole your idea and passed it off as her own?In the pages of The Sociopath Next Door; you will realize that your ex was not just misunderstood. Heâ€™s a sociopath. And your boss; teacher; and colleague? They may be sociopaths too.We are accustomed to think of sociopaths as violent criminals; but in The Sociopath Next Door; Harvard psychologist Martha Stout reveals that a shocking 4 percent of ordinary peopleâ€”one in twenty-fiveâ€”has an often undetected mental disorder; the chief symptom of which is that that person possesses no conscience. He or she has no ability whatsoever to feel shame; guilt; or remorse. One in twenty-five everyday Americans; therefore; is secretly a sociopath. They could be your colleague; your neighbor; even family. And they can do literally anything at all and feel absolutely no guilt. 
How do we recognize the remorseless? One of their chief characteristics is a kind of glow or charisma that makes sociopaths more charming or interesting than the other people around them. Theyâ€™re more spontaneous; more intense; more complex; or even sexier than everyone else; making them tricky to identify and leaving us easily seduced. Fundamentally; sociopaths are different because they cannot love. Sociopaths learn early on to show sham emotion; but underneath they are indifferent to othersâ€suffering. They live to dominate and thrill to win. The fact is; we all almost certainly know at least one or more sociopaths already. Part of the urgency in reading The Sociopath Next Door is the moment when we suddenly recognize that someone we knowâ€”someone we worked for; or were involved with; or voted forâ€”is a sociopath. But what do we do with that knowledge? To arm us against the sociopath; Dr. Stout teaches us to question authority; suspect flattery; and beware the pity play. Above all; she writes; when a sociopath is beckoning; do not join the game. It is the ruthless versus the rest of us; and The Sociopath Next Door will show you how to recognize and defeat the devil you know.",English,USA,256,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388187807l/72536.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Martha Stout,Nonfiction|Psychology|Science|Sociology|Audiobook

9780679444330,The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration,In this epic; beautifully written masterwork; Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities; in search of a better life.Â From 1915 to 1970; this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people; and gained access to new data and official records; to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded; altering our cities; our country; and ourselves.With stunning historical detail; Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney; who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago; where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and; in old age; voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling; who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem; where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights; saw his family fall; and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster; who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career; the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career; which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos; as well as how they changed these cities with southern food; faith; and culture and improved them with discipline; drive; and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment; The Warmth of Other Suns is a bold; remarkable; and riveting work; a superb account of an â€œunrecognized immigrationâ€within our own land. Through the breadth of its narrative; the beauty of the writing; the depth of its research; and the fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein; this book is destined to become a classic.,English,USA,622,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1433354252l/8171378.jpg,Penguin,1988-01-01,Isabel Wilkerson,History|Nonfiction|Race|Cultural|African American|North American Hi...|American History

But when a controversy on the soccer field pushes the two of them to actually talk to each other; they are forced to take each other at something other than face value.The Abstinence Teacher exposes the powerful emotions that run beneath the surface of modern American family life and explores the complex spiritual and sexual lives of ordinary people.

9780547225470,When the Game Was Ours,From the moment these two players took the court on opposing sides; they engaged in a fierce physical and psychological battle. Their uncommonly competitive relationship came to symbolize the most compelling rivalry in the NBA. These were the basketball epics of the 1980s--Celtics vs Lakers; East vs West; physical vs finesse; Old School vs Showtime; even white vs black. Each pushed the other to greatness--together Bird and Johnson collected 8 NBA Championships; and 6 MVP awards and helped save the floundering NBA at its most critical time. When it started they were bitter rivals; but along the way they became lifelong friends.With intimate; fly-on-the-wall detail; When the Game Was Ours transports readers to this electric era of basketball and reveals for the first time the inner workings of two players dead set on besting one another. From the heady days of trading championships to the darker days of injury and illness; we come to understand Larry's obsessive devotion to winning and how his demons drove him on the court. We hear him talk with candor about playing through chronic pain and its truly exacting toll. In Magic we see a young; invincible star struggle with the sting of defeat; not just as a player but as a team leader.

Here; for the first time and in detail; Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment; the landmark study in which a group of college-student volunteers was randomly divided into â€œguardsâ€and â€œinmatesâ€and then placed in a mock prison environment. Within a week; the study was abandoned; as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal; sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners. By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses; Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena; from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib. He replaces the long-held notion of the â€œbad appleâ€with that of the â€œbad barrelâ€â€”the idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual; rather than the other way around.",English,USA,551,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388365513l/359194.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2012-08-09,Philip G.

With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene; when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia; Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich; tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here; into the unsettled ground of science; faith; and everyday truces between reason and conviction. Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now; after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm; she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst; she encounters a shocking sight: a silent; forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle; but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists; religious leaders; and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists; opportunists; sightseers; and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle; Dellarobia confronts her family; her church; her town; and a larger world; in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.

One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer--a pastor and author; known as much for such spiritual classics as ""The Cost of Discipleship ""and ""Life Together;"" as for his 1945 execution in a concentration camp for his part in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.In the first major biography of Bonhoeffer in forty years; ""New York Times"" best-selling author Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's lifeâ€•the theologian and the spyâ€•to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil. In a deeply moving narrative; Metaxas uses previously unavailable documentsâ€•including personal letters; detailed journal entries; and firsthand personal accountsâ€•to reveal dimensions of Bonhoeffer's life and theology never before seen.In ""Bonhoeffer: Pastor; Martyr; Prophet; Spy""â€A Righteous Gentile vs the Third Reich; Metaxas presents the fullest accounting of Bonhoeffer's heart-wrenching 1939 decision to leave the safe haven of America for Hitler's Germany; and using extended excerpts from love letters and coded messages written to and from Bonhoeffer's Cell 92; Metaxas tells for the first time the full story of Bonhoeffer's passionate and tragic romance.Readers will discover fresh insights and revelations about his life-changing months at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and about his radical position on why Christians are obliged to stand up for the Jews. Metaxas also sheds new light on Bonhoeffer's reaction to Kristallnacht; his involvement in the famous Valkyrie plot and in Operation 7; the effort to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland.Bonhoeffer gives witness to one man's extraordinary faith and to the tortured fate of the nation he sought to deliver from the curse of Nazism.

Later it was said that both had fallen ill; but the truth is different. The real story starts much earlier; in 1961; with the birth of Nombeko Mayeki in a shack in Soweto. Nombeko was fated to grow up fast and die early in her poverty-stricken township; be it from drugs; alcohol; or just plain despair. But Nombeko takes a different path. She finds work as a housecleaner and eventually makes her way up to the position of chief advisor; at the helm of one of the world's most secret projects.

9781416553650,Born Standing Up: A Comic's Life,In the midseventies; Steve Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is; in his own words; the story of why I did stand-up and why I walked away. Emmy and Grammy Award winner; author of the acclaimed New York Times bestsellers Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company; and a regular contributor to The New Yorker; Martin has always been a writer. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid; spectacularly amusing; and beautifully written. At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland; selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed; he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm; performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years; during which he practiced and honed his craft; is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. Martin illuminates the sacrifice; discipline; and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good; to perform so frequently; was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister; and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times-the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam; the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late sixties; and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the seventies.Throughout the text; Martin has placed photographs; many never seen before. Born Standing Up is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity; focus; and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.,English,USA,207 ,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348034328l/773858.jpg,Penguin,1970-02-01,Steve Martin,Nonfiction|Biography|Autobiography|Memoir|Humor|Humor|Comedy

9781400064990,A. Lincoln,NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BYThe Washington PostÂ â€¢Â The Philadelphia Inquirer â€¢Â The Christian Science Monitor â€St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Â NEW YORK TIMES Â BESTSELLERWINNER OF THE CHRISTOPHER AWARDEveryone wants to define the man who signed his name â€œA. Lincoln.â€In his lifetime and ever since; friend and foe have taken it upon themselves to characterize Lincoln according to their own label or libel. In this magnificent book; Ronald C. White; Jr.; offers a fresh and compelling definition of Lincoln as a man of integrityâ€“what todayâ€™s commentators would call â€œauthenticityâ€â€“whose moral compass holds the key to understanding his life. Through meticulous research of the newly completed Lincoln Legal Papers; as well as of recently discovered letters and photographs; White provides a portrait of Lincolnâ€™s personal; political; and moral evolution. White shows us Lincoln as a man who would leave a trail of thoughts in his wake; jotting ideas on scraps of paper and filing them in his top hat or the bottom drawer of his desk; a country lawyer who asked questions in order to figure out his own thinking on an issue; as much as to argue the case; a hands-on commander in chief who; as soldiers and sailors watched in amazement; commandeered a boat and ordered an attack on Confederate shore batteries at the tip of the Virginia peninsula; a man who struggled with the immorality of slavery and as president acted publicly and privately to outlaw it forever; and finally; a president involved in a religious odyssey who wrote; for his own eyes only; a profound meditation on â€œthe will of Godâ€in the Civil War that would become the basis of his finest address. Most enlightening; the Abraham Lincoln who comes into focus in this stellar narrative is a person of intellectual curiosity; comfortable with ambiguity; unafraid to â€œthink anew and act anew.â€ A transcendent; sweeping; passionately written biography that greatly expands our knowledge and understanding of its subject; A. Lincoln will engage a whole new generation of Americans.

9781591842800,Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action,Why do you do what you do? Why are some people and organizations more innovative; more influential; and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful; why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?  People like Martin Luther King Jr.; Steve Jobs; and the Wright Brothers might have little in common; but they all started with why. It was their natural ability to start with why that enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things.  In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world; Simon Sinek discovered that they all think; act; and communicate in the exact same way -- and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle; and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built; movements can be lead; and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.  Any organization can explain what it does; some can explain how they do it; but very few can clearly articulate why. WHY is not money or profit-- those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders; but not others?  Starting with WHY works in big business and small business; in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate; they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to.  Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories; Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire. This book is for anyone who wants to inspire others or who wants to find someone to inspire them.,English,USA,256 ,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360936414l/7108725.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Simon Sinek,Business|Leadership|Nonfiction|Self Help|Self Help|Personal Development|Business|Management

9780300108840,A Little History of the World,In 1935; with a doctorate in art history and no prospect of a job; the 26-year-old Ernst Gombrich was invited by a publishing acquaintance to attempt a history of the world for younger readers. Amazingly; he completed the task in an intense six weeks; and Eine kurze Weltgeschichte fÃ¼r junge Leser was published in Vienna to immediate success; and is now available in seventeen languages across the world.

9780553447440,Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,New York Times BestsellerFrom Harvard sociologist and MacArthur Genius Matthew Desmond; a landmark work of scholarship and reportage that will forever change the way we look at poverty in AmericaÂ In this brilliant; heartbreaking book; Matthew Desmond takes us into the poorest neighborhoods of Milwaukee to tell the story of eight families on the edge. Arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the $20 a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment. Scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction. Lamar; a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after; tries to work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are spending almost everything they have on rent; and all have fallen behind. The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver; a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur; and Tobin Charney; who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others; but as Sherrena puts it; â€œLove donâ€™t pay the bills.â€She moves to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas. Even in the most desolate areas of American cities; evictions used to be rare. But today; most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing; and eviction has become ordinary; especially for single mothers. In vivid; intimate prose; Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forcedÂ  into shelters; squalid apartments; or more dangerous neighborhoods; we bear witness to the human cost of Americaâ€™s vast inequalityâ€”and to peopleâ€™s determination and intelligence in the face of hardship. Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data; this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating; uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home; without which nothing else is possible.From the Hardcover edition.,English,USA,418 ,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1453060710l/25852784.jpg,Crossley,2010-05-05,Matthew Desmond,Nonfiction|Sociology|Politics|History|Social Movements|Social Justice

But today; success is increasingly dependent on how we interact with others. It turns out that at work; most people operate as either takers; matchers; or givers. Whereas takers strive to get as much as possible from others and matchers aim to trade evenly; givers are the rare breed of people who contribute to others without expecting anything in return.

Although some givers get exploited and burn out; the rest achieve extraordinary results across a wide range of industries. Combining cutting-edge evidence with captivating stories; this landmark book shows how one of America's best networkers developed his connections; why the creative genius behind one of the most popular shows in television history toiled for years in anonymity; how a basketball executive responsible for multiple draft busts transformed his franchise into a winner; and how we could have anticipated Enron's demise four years before the company collapsed - without ever looking at a single number.

9780804140840,Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being; Wisdom; and Wonder,"In Thrive; Arianna Huffington makes an impassioned and compelling case for the need to redefine what it means to be successful in today's world.Arianna Huffington's personal wake-up call came in the form of a broken cheekbone and a nasty gash over her eye -- the result of a fall brought on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. As the cofounder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group -- one of the fastest growing media companies in the world -- celebrated as one of the world's most influential women; and gracing the covers of magazines; she was; by any traditional measure; extraordinarily successful. Yet as she found herself going from brain MRI to CAT scan to echocardiogram; to find out if there was any underlying medical problem beyond exhaustion; she wondered is this really what success feels like?As more and more people are coming to realize; there is far more to living a truly successful life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office. Our relentless pursuit of the two traditional metrics of success -- money and power -- has led to an epidemic of burnout and stress-related illnesses; and an erosion in the quality of our relationships; family life; and; ironically; our careers. In being connected to the world 24/7; we're losing our connection to what truly matters. Our current definition of success is; as Thrive shows; literally killing us. We need a new way forward.In a commencement address Arianna gave at Smith College in the spring of 2013; she likened our drive for money and power to two legs of a three-legged stool. They may hold us up temporarily; but sooner or later we're going to topple over. We need a third leg -- a third metric for defining success -- to truly thrive. That third metric; she writes in Thrive; includes our well-being; our ability to draw on our intuition and inner wisdom; our sense of wonder; and our capacity for compassion and giving. As Arianna points out; our eulogies celebrate our lives very differently from the way society defines success. They don't commemorate our long hours in the office; our promotions; or our sterling PowerPoint presentations as we relentlessly raced to climb up the career ladder. They are not about our resumes -- they are about cherished memories; shared adventures; small kindnesses and acts of generosity; lifelong passions; and the things that made us laugh.In this deeply personal book; Arianna talks candidly about her own challenges with managing time and prioritizing the demands of a career and raising two daughters -- of juggling business deadlines and family crises; a harried dance that led to her collapse and to her ""aha moment."" Drawing on the latest groundbreaking research and scientific findings in the fields of psychology; sports; sleep; and physiology that show the profound and transformative effects of meditation; mindfulness; unplugging; and giving; Arianna shows us the way to a revolution in our culture; our thinking; our workplace; and our lives.",English,USA,352,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400873884l/18594634.jpg,Crossley,2002-01-02,Arianna Huffington,Nonfiction|Business|Self Help|Self Help|Personal Development|Health

Across the globe; we sat riveted to television and computer screensÂ as journalists flocked to the Atacama desert. While we saw what transpired above ground during the grueling and protracted rescue; the story of the minersâ€experiences below the earthâ€™s surfaceâ€”and the lives that led them thereâ€”hasnâ€™t been heard until now.Â Â Â Â  In Deep Down Dark; aÂ master work by a Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning journalist; HÃ©ctor Tobar gains exclusive access to the miners and their stories. The result is a miraculous and emotionally textured account of theÂ thirty-three men who came to think of the San JosÃ© mine as a kind of coffin; as a â€œcaveâ€inflicting constant and thundering aural torment; and as a church where they sought redemption through prayer while the world watched from above. It offers an understanding of the families and personal histories that brought â€œlos 33â€to the mine; and the mystical and spiritual elements that surrounded working in such a dangerous place.,English,USA,14,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1409498752l/20696430.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,HÃ©ctor Tobar|Henry Leyva,Nonfiction|Audiobook
9780809594080,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"Headless horsemen were staples of Northern European storytelling; featuring in German; Irish (e.g. Dullahan); Scandinavian (e.g. the Wild Hunt) and English legends and were included in Robert Burns's ""Tam o' Shanter"" (1790); and Burger's Der wilde Jager; translated as The Wild Huntsman (1796). Usually viewed as omens of ill-fortune for those who chose to disregard their apparitions; these specters found their victims in proud; scheming persons and characters with hubris and arrogance. The chief part of the stories; however; turned upon the favorite specter of Sleepy Hollow; the Headless Horseman; who had been heard several times of late; patrolling the country; and; it was said; tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard. The story was immediately matched by a thrice marvelous adventure of Brom Bones; who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey. He affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing; he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with him for a bowl of punch and should have won it too; for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow; but just as they came to the church bridge; the Hessian bolted; and vanished in a flash of fire. All these tales; told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in the dark; the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe; sank deep in the mind of Ichabod.",English,USA,108,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348108368l/93261.jpg,Crossley,2012-08-09,Washington Irving,Classics|Horror|Fiction|Short Stories|Fantasy|Gothic
9780385350820,Dept. of Speculation,"Dept. of Speculation is a portrait of a marriage. It is also a beguiling rumination on the mysteries of intimacy; trust; faith; knowledge; and the condition of universal shipwreck that unites us all. Jenny Offill's heroine; referred to in these pages as simply ""the wife;"" once exchanged love letters with her husband postmarked Dept. of Speculation; their code name for all the uncertainty that inheres in life and in the strangely fluid confines of a long relationship. As they confront an array of common catastrophes - a colicky baby; a faltering marriage; stalled ambitions - the wife analyzes her predicament; invoking everything from Keats and Kafka to the thought experiments of the Stoics to the lessons of doomed Russian cosmonauts. She muses on the consuming; capacious experience of maternal love; and the near total destruction of the self that ensues from it as she confronts the friction between domestic life and the seductions and demands of art. With cool precision; in language that shimmers with rage and wit and fierce longing; Jenny Offill has crafted an exquisitely suspenseful love story that has the velocity of a train hurtling through the night at top speed. Exceptionally lean and compact; Dept. of Speculation is a novel to be devoured in a single sitting; though its bracing emotional insights and piercing meditations on despair and love will linger long after the last page.",English,USA,180,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411927412l/18473997.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1988-01-01,Jenny Offill,Fiction|Contemporary|Literary Fiction|Novels

Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control; McGonigal created a course called ""The Science of Willpower"" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful Psychology Today blog with the same name.Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology; economics; neuroscience; and medicine; McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is; how it works; and why it matters. Readers will learn:Willpower is a mind-body response; not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness; exercise; nutrition; and sleep. People who have better control of their attention; emotions; and actions are healthier; happier; have more satisfying relationships; and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health.

It was the only thing weâ€™d ever done together as father and son; and I promised not to tell. But unlike most dreams; the memory of this one never left me. And sometimesâ€¦I wasnâ€™t altogether sure about one thing: was it just a dream?â€When Augusten Burroughs was small; his father was a shadowy presence in his life: a form on the stairs; a cough from the basement; a silent figure smoking a cigarette in the dark. As Augusten grew older; something sinister within his father began to unfurl.Â  Something dark and secretive that could not be named.Â Betrayal after shocking betrayal ensued; and Augustenâ€™s childhood was over. The kind of father he wanted didnâ€™t exist for him. This father was distant; aloof; uninterestedâ€¦And then the â€œgamesâ€began.With ""A Wolf at the Table""; Augusten Burroughs makes a quantum leap into untapped emotional terrain: the radical pendulum swing between love and hate; the unspeakably terrifying relationship between father and son. Told with scorching honesty and penetrating insight; it is a story for anyone who has ever longed for unconditional love from a parent. Though harrowing and brutal; ""A Wolf at the Table"" will ultimately leave you buoyed with the profound joy of simply being alive.

From the debacle in Bataan; to the miracle at Midway and the relentless vortex of Guadalcanal; their solemn oaths to their country later led one to the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot and the others to the coral strongholds of Peleliu; the black terraces of Iwo Jima and the killing fields of Okinawa; until at last the survivors enjoyed a triumphant; yet uneasy; return home.  In The Pacific; Hugh Ambrose focuses on the real-life stories of the five men who put their lives on the line for our country. To deepen the story revealed in the miniseries and go beyond it; the book dares to chart a great ocean of enmity known as The Pacific and the brave men who fought. Some considered war a profession; others enlisted as citizen soldiers. Each man served in a different part of the war; but their respective duties required every ounce of their courage and their strength to defeat an enemy who preferred suicide to surrender. The medals for valor which were pinned on three of them came at a shocking price-a price paid in full by all.,English,UK,489,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347284164l/7494887.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Hugh Ambrose,History|Nonfiction|War|War|Military Fiction|War|World War II|Military|Military History

9780345530420,The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping; Cover-ups; and Winning at All Costs,"
NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â€WINNER OF THE WILLIAM HILL SPORTS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD
The Secret Race is a definitive look at the world of professional cyclingâ€”and the doping issue surrounding this sport and its most iconic rider; Lance Armstrongâ€”by former Olympic gold medalist Tyler Hamilton and New York Times bestselling author Daniel Coyle.Over the course of two years; Coyle conducted more than two hundred hours of interviews with Hamilton and spoke candidly with numerous teammates; rivals; and friends. The result is an explosive book that takes us; for the first time; deep inside a shadowy; fascinating; and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors; anything-goes team directors; and athletes so relentlessly driven to succeed that they would do anythingâ€”and take any risk; physical; mental; or moralâ€”to gain the edge they need to win.Tyler Hamilton was once one of the worldâ€™s best-liked and top-ranked cyclistsâ€”a fierce competitor renowned among his peers for his uncanny endurance and epic tolerance for pain. In the 2003 Tour de France; he finished fourth despite breaking his collarbone in the early stagesâ€”and grinding eleven of his teeth down to the nerves along the way. He started his career with the U.S. Postal Service team in the 1990s and quickly rose to become Lance Armstrongâ€™s most trusted lieutenant; and a member of his inner circle. For the first three of Armstrongâ€™s record seven Tour de France victories; Hamilton was by Armstrongâ€™s side; clearing his way. But just weeks after Hamilton reached his own personal pinnacleâ€”winning the gold medal at the 2004 Olympicsâ€”his career came to a sudden; ignominious end: He was found guilty of doping and exiled from the sport.From the exhilaration of his early; naÃ¯ve days in the peloton; Hamilton chronicles his ascent to the uppermost reaches of this unforgiving sport. In the mid-1990s; the advent of a powerful new blood-boosting drug called EPO reshaped the world of cycling; and a relentless; win-at-any-cost ethos took root. Its psychological toll would drive many of the sportâ€™s top performers to substance abuse; depression; even suicide. For the first time ever; Hamilton recounts his own battle with clinical depression; speaks frankly about the agonizing choices that go along with the decision to compete at a world-class level; and tells the story of his complicated relationship with Lance Armstrong.A journey into the heart of a never-before-seen world; The Secret Race is a riveting; courageous act of witness from a man who is as determined to reveal the hard truth about his sport as he once was to win the Tour de France.",English,USA,290,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344963275l/15823426.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1970-02-01,Tyler Hamilton|Daniel Coyle,Nonfiction|Sports and Games|Sports|Sports|Cycling|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography

To everyone else itâ€™s Dragonscale; a highly contagious; deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodiesâ€”before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.Harper Grayson; a compassionate; dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins; treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now sheâ€™s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began; she and her husband; Jakob; had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakobâ€™s dismay; Harper wants to liveâ€”at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital; she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick; Jakob becomes unhinged; and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squadsâ€”armed; self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isnâ€™t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital; a man in a dirty yellow fire fighterâ€™s jacket; carrying a hooked iron bar; straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman; he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire; a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself; using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged.In the desperate season to come; as the world burns out of control; Harper must learn the Firemanâ€™s secrets before her lifeâ€”and that of her unborn childâ€”goes up in smoke.,English,UK,752,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1469316385l/25816688.jpg,Macmillan,2010-05-05,Joe Hill,Horror|Fiction|Science Fiction|Fantasy|Thriller|Science Fiction|Dystopia

To even the odds; Penn must rely on allies whose objectives are very different from his own.

9780385512050,Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success; One Relationship at a Time,"Do you want to get ahead in life? Climb the ladder to personal success? The secret; master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims; is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life; what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships--so that everyone wins. In ""Never Eat Alone;"" Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps--and inner mindset--he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues; friends; and associates on his Rolodex; people he has helped and who have helped him. The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady; Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale; a Harvard MBA; and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties; he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington's corridors of power to Hollywood's A-list; leading to him being named one of Crain's 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum. Ferrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity; helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude; desperate glad-handling usually associated with ""networking."" He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical; proven principles. Among them: Don't keep score: It's never simply about getting what you want. It's about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want; too. ""Ping"" constantly: The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time--not just when you need something. Never eat alone: The dynamics of status are the same whether you're working at a corporation or attending a society event-- ""invisibility"" is a fate worse than failure. In the course of the book; Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world's most connected individuals; from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton; Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama. Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection; getting past gatekeepers; becoming a ""conference commando;"" and more; ""Never Eat Alone"" is destined to take its place alongside ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" as an inspirational classic.",English,USA,309,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320417949l/84699.jpg,Random House,2002-01-02,Keith Ferrazzi,Business|Nonfiction|Self Help|Self Help|Personal Development|Leadership

9780865475880,Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things,"""Reduce; reuse; recycle;"" urge environmentalists; in other words; do more with less in order to minimize damage. But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative; visionary book; such an approach only perpetuates the one-way; ""cradle to grave"" manufacturing model; dating to the Industrial Revolution; that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact; why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree; yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe; beautiful; and highly effective.Waste equals food.Guided by this principle; McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that; after their useful lives; they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as ""biological nutrients"" that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be ""technical nutrients"" that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closed-loop industrial cycles; rather than being ""recycled"" -- really; downcycled -- into low-grade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses; McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice; and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well. William McDonough is an architect and the founding principal of William McDonough + Partners; Architecture and Community Design; based in Charlottesville; Virginia. From 1994 to 1999 he served as dean of the school of architecture at the University of Virginia. In 1999 Time magazine recognized him as a ""Hero for the Planet;"" stating that ""his utopianism is grounded in a unified philosophy that -- in demonstrable and practical ways -- is changing the design of the world."" In 1996; he received the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development; the highest environmental honor given by the United States.Michael Braungart is a chemist and the founder of the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency (EPEA) in Hamburg; Germany. Prior to starting EPEA; he was the director of the chemistry section for Greenpeace. Since 1984 he has been lecturing at universities; businesses; and institutions around the world on critical new concepts for ecological chemistry and materials flow management. Dr. Braungart is the recipient of numerous honors; awards; and fellowships from the Heinz Endowment; the W. Alton Jones Foundation; and other organizations.In 1995 the authors created McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry; a product and systems development firm assisting client companies in implementing their unique sustaining design protocol.

He soon learned that many were dead or dyingâ€”among them his own mother and sister. Those who remained were stranded on a lifeless glacier at nearly 12;000 feet above sea level; with no supplies and no means of summoning help. They struggled to endure freezing temperatures; deadly avalanches; and then the devastating news that the search for them had been called off. As time passed and Nandoâ€™s thoughts turned increasingly to his father; who he knew must be consumed with grief; Nando resolved that he must get home or die trying. He would challenge the Andes; even though he was certain the effort would kill him; telling himself that even if he failed he would die that much closer to his father. It was a desperate decision; but it was also his only chance. So Nando; an ordinary young man with no disposition for leadership or heroism; led an expedition up the treacherous slopes of a snow-capped mountain and across forty-five miles of frozen wilderness in an attempt to find help.

More than a million readers have thrilled to Bill O'Reilly's Killing Lincoln; the page-turning work of nonfiction about the shocking assassination that changed the course of American history. Now the anchor of The O'Reilly Factor recounts in gripping detail the brutal murder of John Fitzgerald Kennedyâ€”and how a sequence of gunshots on a Dallas afternoon not only killed a beloved president but also sent the nation into the cataclysmic division of the Vietnam War and its culture-changing aftermath.In January 1961; as the Cold War escalates; John F. Kennedy struggles to contain the growth of Communism while he learns the hardships; solitude; and temptations of what it means to be president of the United States.

9780553803080,Sickened: The Memoir of a Munchausen by Proxy Childhood,"A young girl is perched on the cold chrome of yet another doctorâ€™s examining table; missing yet another day of school. Just twelve; sheâ€™s tall; skinny; and weak. Itâ€™s four oâ€™clock; and she hasnâ€™t been allowed to eat anything all day. Her mother; on the other hand; seems curiously excited. She's about to suggest open-heart surgery on her child to ""get to the bottom of this."" She checks her teeth for lipstick and; as the doctor enters; shoots the girl a warning glance. This child will not ruin her plans.SickenedFrom early childhood; Julie Gregory was continually X-rayed; medicated; and operated onâ€”in the vain pursuit of an illness that was created in her motherâ€™s mind. Munchausen by proxy (MBP) is the worldâ€™s most hidden and dangerous form of child abuse; in which the caretakerâ€”almost always the motherâ€”invents or induces symptoms in her child because she craves the attention of medical professionals. Many MBP children die; but Julie Gregory not only survived; she escaped the powerful orbit of her mother's madness and rebuilt her identity as a vibrant; healthy young woman.Sickened is a remarkable memoir that speaks in an original and distinctive Midwestern voice; rising to indelible scenes in prose of scathing beauty and fierce humor. Punctuated with Julie's actual medical records; it re-creates the bizarre cocoon of her family's isolated double-wide trailer; their wild shopping sprees and gun-waving confrontations; the astonishing naÃ¯vetÃ© of medical professionals and social workers. It also exposes the twisted bonds of terror and love that roped Julie's family togetherâ€”including the love that made a child willing to sacrifice herself to win her mother's happiness. The realization that the sickness lay in her mother; not in herself; would not come to Julie until adulthood. But when it did; it would strike like lightning. Through her painful metamorphosis; she discovered the courage to save her own lifeâ€”and; ultimately; the life of the girl her mother had found to replace her. Sickened takes us to new places in the human heart and spirit. It is an unforgettable story; unforgettably told.",English,UK,244,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388279744l/4507.jpg,Harper Collins,2002-01-02,Julie Gregory,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|Psychology|Biography|Mental Health|Mental Illness|Health|Mental Health

9780307720660,Without You; There Is No Us: My Time with the Sons of North Korea's Elite,"A haunting memoir of teaching English to the sons of North Korea's ruling class during the last six months of Kim Jong-il's reignEvery day; three times a day; the students march in two straight lines; singing praises to Kim Jong-il and North Korea: Without you; there is no motherland. Without you; there is no us. It is a chilling scene; but gradually Suki Kim; too; learns the tune and; without noticing; begins to hum it. It is 2011; and all universities in North Korea have been shut down for an entire year; the students sent to construction fields - except for the 270 students at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST); a walled compound where portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il look on impassively from the walls of every room; and where Suki has accepted a job teaching English. Over the next six months; she will eat three meals a day with her young charges and struggle to teach them to write; all under the watchful eye of the regime. Life at PUST is lonely and claustrophobic; especially for Suki; whose letters are read by censors and who must hide her notes and photographs not only from her minders but from her colleagues - evangelical Christian missionaries who don't know or choose to ignore that Suki doesn't share their faith. She is mystified by how easily her students lie; unnerved by their obedience to the regime. To them; everything in North Korea is the best; the tallest; the most delicious; the envy of all nations. Still; she cannot help but love them - their boyish enthusiasm; their eagerness to please; the flashes of curiosity that have not yet been extinguished. As the weeks pass; she begins to hint at the existence of a world beyond their own - at such exotic activities as surfing the Internet or traveling freely and; more dangerously; at electoral democracy and other ideas forbidden in a country where defectors risk torture and execution. The students in turn offer Suki tantalizing glimpses into their lives; from their thoughts on how to impress girls to their disappointment that soccer games are only televised when the North Korean team wins. Then Kim Jong-il dies; leaving the students devastated; and leading Suki to question whether the gulf between her world and theirs can ever be bridged.Without You; There Is No Us offers a moving and incalculably rare glimpse of life in the world's most unknowable country; and at the privileged young men she calls ""soldiers and slaves.""",English,UK,291,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405292426l/20685373.jpg,Harper Collins,1970-02-01,Suki Kim,Nonfiction|Autobiography|Memoir|History|Politics|Cultural|Asia

9781400069800,Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us,"Every year; the average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar. They ingest 8;500 milligrams of salt a day; double the recommended amount; almost none of which comes from salt shakers. It comes from processed food; an industry that hauls in $1 trillion in annual sales. In Salt Sugar Fat; Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how this happened. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century--including Kraft; Coca-Cola; Lunchables; Kellogg; NestlÃ©; Oreos; Cargill; Capri Sun; and many more--Mossâ€™s explosive; empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous; often eye-opening research.He goes inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the ""bliss point"" of sugary beverages or enhance the ""mouth feel"" of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing techniques taken straight from tobacco company playbooks to redirect concerns about the health risks of products. He talks to concerned executives who explain that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: the industry itself would cease to exist without salt; sugar; and fat.",English,USA,446,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361919312l/15797397.jpg,Hachette,2012-08-09,Michael Moss,Nonfiction|Food and Drink|Food|Health|Science|Health|Nutrition|Audiobook|Business|History|Abandoned|Politics

9780060959520,Elizabeth: The Struggle for the Throne,The legend of Elizabeth I; the untouchable; charismatic Virgin Queen; is a powerful and enduring one. Most biographies focus on the years of her reign; during which she proved herself as adept a ruler -- and as shrewd an operator -- as England had ever seen. But while the history of her rule is fascinating; the story of how her remarkable character was forged seems vital to a full understanding of the woman who led England into a new age of prosperity; power; and artistic achievement. David Starkey's Elizabeth: The Struggle for the Throne explores the terra incognita of Elizabeth's early years; and the result is nothing short of captivating.Starkey finds that Elizabeth's early years ran the gamut from days of snug security as the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn; and Henry's heir apparent; to the years of uncertainty after her mother's execution whenElizabeth was separated from court and virtually forgotten. She received a first-rate academic education; excelling in languages and rhetoric and exhibiting a strong interest in the Protestant religion her father had established in England. But the education she received from life itself would prove far more valuable for the monarch-to-be. After the death of Henry VIII and Edward VI (Elizabeth's half brother); Elizabeth's status as sister and would-be successor to the Catholic queen Mary put her in a dangerous position.It also put her in prison at Mary's command -- and perilously close to execution -- after plots to place Elizabeth on the throne were revealed. Starkey makes it clear that while others may have actually done the dirty work; Elizabeth was usually in the thick of these efforts. Her imprisonment taught her to cover her tracks; but it did not stop her maneuverings. While fervently professing her Catholic faith; she surrounded herself with Protestant advisers and attendants; and bided her time. She evaded another snare of her sister's when Mary attempted to neutralize Elizabeth by marrying her off to a Catholic Spaniard in exchange for naming Elizabeth her successor. Perhaps Elizabeth had learned early on from the plight of her mother that marriage had its drawbacks. Starkey; however; suggests that Elizabeth; in a moment of true regality; would not accept the crown if it came through bullying and capitulation. Again; Elizabeth bided her time.Her seeming patience -- for Starkey reveals that Elizabeth continued to plot -- paid off when Mary; never robust; entered her final illness. Elizabeth managed to convince the now irrational queen that she was; indeed; a staunch Catholic and vowed to preserve England as a Catholic realm. Upon Mary's death; Elizabeth ascended to the throne with no meaningful opposition; thereby beginning what would be a golden age; one of the most legendary reigns in history. Starkey lets us understand; for the first time; the forces that made her into the formidable woman -- and brilliant ruler -- that she would soon prove to be.,English,USA,384,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1402027586l/134958.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,David Starkey,History|Nonfiction|Biography|English History|Tudor Period|European Literature|British Literature

9780099436930,Glue,Glue is the story of four boys growing up in the Edinburgh schemes; and about the loyalties; the experiences - and the secrets - that hold them together into their thirties. Four boys becoming men: Juice Terry; the work-shy fanny-merchant; with corkscrew curls and sticky fingers; Billy the boxer: driven; controlled; playing to his strengths; Carl; the Milky Bar Kid; drifting along to his own soundtrack; and the doomed Gally - who has one less skin than everyone else and seems to find catastrophe at every corner. As we follow their lives from the seventies into the new century - from punk to techno; from speed to Es - we can see each of them trying to struggle out from under the weight of the conditioning of class and culture; peer pressure and their parents' hopes that maybe their sons will do better than they did. What binds the four of them is the friendship formed by the scheme; their school; and their ambition to escape from both; their loyalty fused in street morality: back up your mates; don't hit women and; most importantly; never grass - on anyone. Despite its scale and ambition; Glue has all Irvine Welsh's usual pace and vigour; crackling dialogue; scabrous set-pieces and black; black humour; but it is also a grown-up book about growing up - about the way we live our lives; and what happens to us when things become unstuck.,English,USA,556,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1357448113l/23960.jpg,Random House,2002-01-02,Irvine Welsh,Fiction|Contemporary

9780307591560,The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work,Our most commonly held formula for success is broken.Â Conventional wisdom holds that if we work hard we will be more successful; and if we are more successful; then weâ€™ll be happy. If we can just find that great job; win that next promotion; lose those five pounds; happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this formula is actually backward: Happiness fuels success; not the other way around. When we are positive; our brains become more engaged; creative; motivated; energetic; resilient; and productive at work. This isnâ€™t just an empty mantra. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigorous research in psychology and neuroscience; management studies; and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In The Happiness Advantage; Shawn Achor; who spent over a decade living; researching; and lecturing at Harvard University; draws on his own researchâ€”including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS and KPMGâ€”to fix this broken formula. Using stories and case studies from his work with thousands of Fortune 500 executives in 42 countries; Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive edge at work. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Isolating seven practical; actionable principles that have been tried and tested everywhere from classrooms to boardrooms; stretching from Argentina to Zimbabwe; he shows us how we can capitalize on the Happiness Advantage to improve our performance and maximize our potential. Among the principles he outlines: Â  Â Â Â â€¢Â The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility; so we can seeâ€”and seizeâ€”opportunities wherever we look. Â Â Â â€¢Â The Zorro Circle: how to channel our efforts on small; manageable goals; to gain the leverage to gradually conquer bigger and bigger ones.

9781400067690,The Burgess Boys,"Elizabeth Strout ""animates the ordinary with an astonishing force;"" wrote The New Yorker on the publication of her Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning Olive Kitteridge. The San Francisco Chronicle praised Strout's ""magnificent gift for humanizing characters."" Now the acclaimed author returns with a stunning novel as powerful and moving as any work in contemporary literature.Haunted by the freak accident that killed their father when they were children; Jim and Bob Burgess escaped from their Maine hometown of Shirley Falls for New York City as soon as they possibly could. Jim; a sleek; successful corporate lawyer; has belittled his bighearted brother their whole lives; and Bob; a Legal Aid attorney who idolizes Jim; has always taken it in stride. But their long-standing dynamic is upended when their sister; Susanâ€”the Burgess sibling who stayed behindâ€”urgently calls them home. Her lonely teenage son; Zach; has gotten himself into a world of trouble; and Susan desperately needs their help. And so the Burgess brothers return to the landscape of their childhood; where the long-buried tensions that have shaped and shadowed their relationship begin to surface in unexpected ways that will change them forever. With a rare combination of brilliant storytelling; exquisite prose; and remarkable insight into character; Elizabeth Strout has brought to life two deeply human protagonists whose struggles and triumphs will resonate with readers long after they turn the final page. Tender; tough-minded; loving; and deeply illuminating about the ties that bind us to family and home; The Burgess Boys is Elizabeth Strout's newest and perhaps most astonishing work of literary art.",English,UK,320,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1351213545l/15823461.jpg,Hachette,1988-01-01,Elizabeth Strout,Fiction|Contemporary|Literary Fiction

9780812975290,The Greatest Generation,"""In the spring of 1984; I went to the northwest of France; to Normandy; to prepare an NBC documentary on the fortieth anniversary of D-Day; the massive and daring Allied invasion of Europe that marked the beginning of the end of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. There; I underwent a life-changing experience. As I walked the beaches with the American veterans who had returned for this anniversary; men in their sixties and seventies; and listened to their stories; I was deeply moved and profoundly grateful for all they had done. Ten years later; I returned to Normandy for the fiftieth anniversary of the invasion; and by then I had come to understand what this generation of Americans meant to history. It is; I believe; the greatest generation any society has ever produced.""Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In this superb book; Tom Brokaw goes out into America; to tell through the stories of individual men and women the story of a generation; America's citizen heroes and heroines who came of age during the Great Depression and the Second World War and went on to build modern America. This generation was united not only by a common purpose; but also by common values--duty; honor; economy; courage; service; love of family and country; and; above all; responsibility for oneself. In this book; you will meet people whose everyday lives reveal how a generation persevered through war; and were trained by it; and then went on to create interesting and useful lives and the America we have today.""At a time in their lives when their days and nights should have been filled with innocent adventure; love; and the lessons of the workaday world; they were fighting in the most primitive conditions possible across the bloodied landscape of France; Belgium; Italy; Austria; and the coral islands of the Pacific. They answered the call to save the world from the two most powerful and ruthless military machines ever assembled; instruments of conquest in the hands of fascist maniacs. They faced great odds and a late start; but they did not protest. They succeeded on every front. They won the war; they saved the world. They came home to joyous and short-lived celebrations and immediately began the task of rebuilding their lives and the world they wanted. They married in record numbers and gave birth to another distinctive generation; the Baby Boomers. A grateful nation made it possible for more of them to attend college than any society had ever educated; anywhere. They gave the world new science; literature; art; industry; and economic strength unparalleled in the long curve of history. As they now reach the twilight of their adventurous and productive lives; they remain; for the most part; exceptionally modest. They have so many stories to tell; stories that in many cases they have never told before; because in a deep sense they didn't think that what they were doing was that special; because everyone else was doing it too. ""This book; I hope; will in some small way pay tribute to those men and women who have given us the lives we have today--an American family portrait album of the greatest generation.""Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In this book you'll meet people like Charles Van Gorder; who set up during D-Day a MASH-like medical facility in the middle of the fighting; and then came home to create a clinic and hospital in his hometown. You'll hear George Bush talk about how; as a Navy Air Corps combat pilot; one of his assignments was to read the mail of the enlisted men under him; to be sure no sensitive military information would be compromised. And so; Bush says; ""I learned about life."" You'll meet Trudy Elion; winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine; one of the many women in this book who found fulfilling careers in the changed society as a result of the war. You'll meet Martha Putney; one of the first black women to serve in the newly formed WACs. And you'll meet the members of the Romeo Club (Retired Old Men Eating Out); friends for life. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Through these and other stories in The Greatest Generation; you'll relive with ordinary men and women; military heroes; famous people of great achievement; and community leaders how these extraordinary times forged the values and provided the training that made a people and a nation great.From the Hardcover edition.",English,USA,464,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386924595l/32987.jpg,Harper Collins,1988-01-01,Tom Brokaw,History|Nonfiction|Biography|War|World War II|North American Hi...|American History

9781936365530,How Music Works,How Music Works is David Byrneâ€™s remarkable and buoyant celebration of a subject he has spent a lifetime thinking about. In it he explores how profoundly music is shaped by its time and place; and he explains how the advent of recording technology in the twentieth century forever changed our relationship to playing; performing; and listening to music.Acting as historian and anthropologist; raconteur and social scientist; he searches for patternsâ€”and shows how those patterns have affected his own work over the years with Talking Heads and his many collaborators; from Brian Eno to Caetano Veloso. Byrne sees music as part of a larger; almost Darwinian pattern of adaptations and responses to its cultural and physical context. His range is panoptic; taking us from Wagnerian opera houses to African villages; from his earliest high school reel-to-reel recordings to his latest work in a home music studio (and all the big studios in between).Touching on the joy; the physics; and even the business of making music; How Music Works is a brainy; irresistible adventure and an impassioned argument about musicâ€™s liberating; life-affirming power.,English,UK,345,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340792878l/13235689.jpg,Macmillan,1988-01-01,David Byrne,Music|Nonfiction|History|Art

9781451617530,The Girls of Atomic City: The Untold Story of the Women Who Helped Win World War II,"
The incredible story of the young women of Oak Ridge; Tennessee; who unwittingly played a crucial role in one of the most significant moments in U.S. history.
The Tennessee town of Oak Ridge was created from scratch in 1942. One of the Manhattan Projectâ€™s secret cities; it didnâ€™t appear on any maps until 1949; and yet at the height of World War II it was using more electricity than New York City and was home to more than 75;000 people; many of them young women recruited from small towns across the South. Their jobs were shrouded in mystery; but they were buoyed by a sense of shared purpose; close friendshipsâ€”and a surplus of handsome scientists and Army men!But against this vibrant wartime backdrop; a darker story was unfolding. The penalty for talking about their workâ€”even the most innocuous detailsâ€”was job loss and eviction. One woman was recruited to spy on her coworkers. They all knew something big was happening at Oak Ridge; but few could piece together the true nature of their work until the bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped over Hiroshima; Japan; and the secret was out. The shocking revelation: the residents of Oak Ridge were enriching uranium for the atomic bomb.Though the young women originally believed they would leave Oak Ridge after the war; many met husbands there; made lifelong friends; and still call the seventy-year-old town home. The reverberations from their work thereâ€”work they didnâ€™t fully understand at the timeâ€”are still being felt today. In The Girls of Atomic City; Denise Kiernan traces the astonishing story of these unsung WWII workers through interviews with dozens of surviving women and other Oak Ridge residents. Like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks; this is history and science made fresh and vibrantâ€”a beautifully told; deeply researched story that unfolds in a suspenseful and exciting way.",English,USA,373,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1352912866l/15801668.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1988-01-01,Denise Kiernan,Nonfiction|History|War|World War II|Science|Historical

9780747553860,Pastoralia,"From an author named by The New Yorker as one of the ""20 Best American Fiction Writers Under 40;"" a hilarious; inventive; unforgettable collection of stories.His remarkable first collection of stories was hailed by The New York Times as ""the debut of an exciting new voice in fiction."" Garrison Keillor called him wildly funny; pure; generous--all that a great humorist should be."" With this new collection; George Saunders takes us even further into the shocking; uproarious and oddly familiar landscape of his imagination.The stories in Pastoralia are set in a slightly skewed version of America; where elements of contemporary life have been merged; twisted; and amplified; casting their absurdity-and our humanity-in a startling new light. Whether he writes a gothic morality tale in which a male exotic dancer is haunted by his maiden aunt from beyond the grave; or about a self-help guru who tells his followers his mission is to discover who's been ""crapping in your oatmeal;"" Saunders's stories are both indelibly strange and vividly real. George Saunders has been identified as a writer in the tradition of Mark Twain; Thomas Pynchon; and Kurt Vonnegut--""a savage satirist with a sentimental streak;"" said The New York Times.

9780553803520,Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships,Emotional Intelligence was an international phenomenon; appearing on the New York Times bestseller list for over a year and selling more than five million copies worldwide. Now; once again; Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science; revealing that we are â€œwired to connectâ€and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives.Far more than we are consciously aware; our daily encounters with parents; spouses; bosses; and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodiesâ€”down to the level of our genesâ€”for good or ill. In Social Intelligence; Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability; constantly engaged in a â€œneural balletâ€that connects us brain to brain with those around us.Our reactions to others; and theirs to us; have a far-reaching biological impact; sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems; making good relationships act like vitaminsâ€”and bad relationships like poisons. We can â€œcatchâ€other peopleâ€™s emotions the way we catch a cold; and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions; the basis of charisma and emotional power; the complexity of sexual attraction; and how we detect lies. He describes the â€œdark sideâ€of social intelligence; from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for â€œmindsight;â€as well as the tragedy of those; like autistic children; whose mindsight is impaired.Is there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace? The answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought. And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy; cooperation; and altruismâ€“provided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.From the Trade Paperback edition.,English,USA,403,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441586645l/26324.jpg,Harper Collins,1988-01-01,Daniel Goleman,Psychology|Nonfiction|Science|Self Help|Sociology|Business|Relationships

9781581344980,Don't Waste Your Life,"John Piper writes; ""I will tell you what a tragedy is. I will show you how to waste your life. Consider this story from the February 1998 Reader's Digest: A couple 'took early retirement from their jobs in the Northeast five years ago when he was 59 and she was 51. Now they live in Punta Gorda; Florida; where they cruise on their 30-foot trawler; play softball and collect shells. . . .' Picture them before Christ at the great day of judgment: 'Look; Lord. See my shells.' That is a tragedy.""God created us to live with a single passion to joyfully display his supreme excellence in all the spheres of life. The wasted life is the life without this passion. God calls us to pray and think and dream and plan and work not to be made much of; but to make much of him in every part of our lives.""Most people slip by in life without a passion for God; spending their lives on trivial diversions; living for comfort and pleasure; and perhaps trying to avoid sin. This book will warn you not to get caught up in a life that counts for nothing. It will challenge you to live and die boasting in the cross of Christ and making the glory of God your singular passion. If you believe that to live is Christ and to die is gain; read this book; learn to live for Christ; and don't waste your life!",English,UK,191,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369824233l/347656.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,John Piper,Christian|Christian|Christian Living|Religion|Theology|Nonfiction|Religion|Christianity|Religion|Faith

Performing as a living statue in a wedding dress; she wordlessly asked thousands of passersby for their dollars. When she became a singer; songwriter; and musician; she was not afraid to ask her audience to support her as she surfed the crowd (and slept on their couches while touring). And when she left her record label to strike out on her own; she asked her fans to support her in making an album; leading to the world's most successful music Kickstarter.Even while Amanda is both celebrated and attacked for her fearlessness in asking for help; she finds that there are important things she cannot ask for-as a musician; as a friend; and as a wife.

The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally; igniting global conversations about women and ambition.

Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally; and in the world of big business; a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women.In Lean In; Sheryl Sandberg â€Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business â€draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves; and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.,English,UK,217,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364250803l/16071764.jpg,Harper Collins,2012-08-09,Sheryl Sandberg|Nell Scovell,Nonfiction|Business|Feminism|Self Help|Leadership

9781400067600,The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love; Character; and Achievement,With unequaled insight and brio; David Brooks; the New York Times columnist and bestselling author of Bobos in Paradise; has long explored and explained the way we live. Now; with the intellectual curiosity and emotional wisdom that make his columns among the most read in the nation; Brooks turns to the building blocks of human flourishing in a multilayered; profoundly illuminating work grounded in everyday life.This is the story of how success happens. It is told through the lives of one composite American couple; Harold and Ericaâ€”how they grow; push forward; are pulled back; fail; and succeed. Distilling a vast array of information into these two vividly realized characters; Brooks illustrates a fundamental new understanding of human nature. A scientific revolution has occurredâ€”we have learned more about the human brain in the last thirty years than we had in the previous three thousand. The unconscious mind; it turns out; is most of the mindâ€”not a dark; vestigial place but a creative and enchanted one; where most of the brainâ€™s work gets done. This is the realm of emotions; intuitions; biases; longings; genetic predispositions; personality traits; and social norms: the realm where character is formed and where our most important life decisions are made. The natural habitat of The Social Animal.Â Drawing on a wealth of current research from numerous disciplines; Brooks takes Harold and Erica from infancy to school; from the â€œodyssey yearsâ€that have come to define young adulthood to the high walls of poverty; from the nature of attachment; love; and commitment; to the nature of effective leadership. He reveals the deeply social aspect of our very minds and exposes the bias in modern culture that overemphasizes rationalism; individualism; and IQ. Along the way; he demolishes conventional definitions of success while looking toward a culture based on trust and humility.The Social Animal is a moving and nuanced intellectual adventure; a story of achievement and a defense of progress. Impossible to put down; it is an essential book for our time; one that will have broad social impact and will change the way we see ourselves and the world.,English,USA,424,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348711254l/9628743.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,David  Brooks,Psychology|Nonfiction|Sociology|Social Science|Science

9780785263720,Searching for God Knows What,"In Searching for God Knows What; Donald Miller's provocative and funny book; he shows readers that the greatest desire of ""every"" person is the desire for redemption. Every person is constantly seeking redemption (or at least the feeling of it) in his or her life; believing countless gospels that promise to fix the brokenness. Typically their pursuits include the desire for fulfilling relationships; successful careers; satisfying religious systems; status; and escape. Miller reveals how the inability to find redemption leads to chaotic relationships; self-hatred; the accumulation of meaningless material possessions; and a lack of inner peace. Readers will learn to identify in themselves and within others the universal desire for redemption. They will discover that the gospel of Jesus is the only way to find meaning in life and true redemption. Mature believers as well as seekers and new Christians will find themselves identifying with the narrative journey unfolded in the book; which is simply the pursuit of redemption.In Searching for God Knows What; best-selling author Donald Miller invites you to reconnect with a faith worth believing. With humor; intelligence; and his trademark writing style; he shows that relationship is Godâ€™s way of leading us to redemption. And our need for redemption drives us to relationship with God. â€œBeing a Christian;â€Miller writes; â€œis more like falling in love than understanding a series of ideas.â€Maybe you are a Christian wondering what faith you signed up for. Or maybe you donâ€™t believe anything and are daring someoneâ€”anyoneâ€”to show you a genuine example of authentic faith. Somewhere beyond the self-help formulas; fancy marketing; and easy promises there is a life-changing experience with God waiting.

A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words; boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful; manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often; Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries; they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time; love; energy; or money? - Aren't boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries?

9781565125700,Mudbound,"In Jordan's prize-winning debut; prejudice takes many forms; both subtle and brutal. It is 1946; and city-bred Laura McAllan is trying to raise her children on her husband's Mississippi Delta farm - a place she finds foreign and frightening. In the midst of the family's struggles; two young men return from the war to work the land. Jamie McAllan; Laura's brother-in-law; is everything her husband is not - charming; handsome; and haunted by his memories of combat. Ronsel Jackson; eldest son of the black sharecroppers who live on the McAllan farm; has come home with the shine of a war hero. But no matter his bravery in defense of his country; he is still considered less than a man in the Jim Crow South. It is the unlikely friendship of these brothers-in-arms that drives this powerful novel to its inexorable conclusion. The men and women of each family relate their versions of events and we are drawn into their lives as they become players in a tragedy on the grandest scale. As Kingsolver says of Hillary Jordan; ""Her characters walked straight out of 1940s Mississippi and into the part of my brain where sympathy and anger and love reside; leaving my heart racing.

9780670022950,The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,Weâ€™ve all had the experience of reading about a bloody war or shocking crime and asking; â€œWhat is the world coming to?â€But we seldom ask; â€œHow bad was the world in the past?â€In this startling new book; the best-selling cognitive scientist Steven Pinker shows that the world of the past was much worse. In fact; we may be living in the most peaceable era in our speciesâ€existence.Evidence of a bloody history has always been around us: the genocides in the Old Testament and crucifixions in the New; the gory mutilations in Shakespeare and Grimm; the British monarchs who beheaded their relatives and the American founders who dueled with their rivals; the nonchalant treatment in popular culture of wife-beating; child abuse; and the extermination of native peoples. Now the decline in these brutal practices can be quantified.With the help of more than a hundred graphs and maps; Pinker presents some astonishing numbers. Tribal warfare was nine times as deadly as war and genocide in the 20th century. The murder rate in medieval Europe was more than thirty times what it is today. Slavery; sadistic punishments; and frivolous executions were unexceptionable features of life for millennia; then suddenly were targeted for abolition. Wars between developed countries have vanished; and even in the developing world; wars kill a fraction of the numbers they did a few decades ago. Rape; battering; hate crimes; deadly riots; child abuse; cruelty to animals â€all substantially down.How could this have happened; if human nature has not changed? What led people to stop sacrificing children; stabbing each other at the dinner table; or burning cats and disemboweling criminals as forms of popular entertainment? Was it reading novels; cultivating table manners; fearing the police; or turning their energies to making money? Should the nuclear bomb get the Nobel Peace Prize for preventing World War III? Does rock and roll deserve the blame for the doubling of violence in the 1960s â€and abortion deserve credit for the reversal in the 1990s?Not exactly; Pinker argues. The key to explaining the decline of violence is to understand the inner demons that incline us toward violence (such as revenge; sadism; and tribalism) and the better angels that steer us away. Thanks to the spread of government; literacy; trade; and cosmopolitanism; we increasingly control our impulses; empathize with others; bargain rather than plunder; debunk toxic ideologies; and deploy our powers of reason to reduce the temptations of violence.With the panache and intellectual zeal that have made his earlier books international best sellers and literary classics; Pinker will force you to rethink your deepest beliefs about progress; modernity; and human nature. This gripping book is sure to be among the most debated of the century so far.,English,USA,0,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1329486876l/13488875.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Steven Pinker|Arthur Morey,Nonfiction|History|Psychology|Science|Philosophy|Sociology

A beautiful and mysterious valley surrounded by steep; jagged mountain peaks deep within the island's uncharted jungle; this hidden retreat was named after the fabled paradise in the bestselling novel Lost Horizon. But unlike the peaceful Tibetan monks of James Hilton's book; this Shangri-La was the home of Stone Age warriors - spear-carrying tribesmen rumored to be headhunters and cannibals. But the pleasure tour became an unforgettable battle for survival when the plane crashed. Miraculously; three passengers survived - WAC Corporal Margaret Hastings; Lieutenant John McCollom; and Sergeant Kenneth Decker. Margaret; barefoot and burned; had no choice but to wear her dead best friend's shoes. McCollom; grieving the death of his twin brother also aboard the Gremlin Special; masked his grief with stoicism. Decker; too; was severely burned and suffered a bloody; gaping head wound.Emotionally devastated; badly injured; and vulnerable to disease; parasites; and poisonous snakes in the wet jungle climate; the trio faced certain death unless they left the wreckage. Caught between man-eating headhunters and the enemy Japanese; with nothing to sustain them but a handful of candy and their own fortitude; they endured a harrowing trek down the mountainside - an exhausting journey into the unknown that would lead them straight into a primitive tribe of superstitious natives who had never before seen a white man - or woman.Drawn from personal interviews; declassified Army documents; personal photos and mementos; a daily journal kept between the crash and the rescue effort; and original film footage; Lost in Shangri-La recounts this incredible true-life adventure for the first time. Mitchell Zuckoff reveals how the determined trio - dehydrated; sick; and in pain - traversed the dense jungle foliage to find help; how a brave band of Filipino-American paratroopers; led by a dogged captain; risked their own lives to save the survivors; how the Americans would be protected by and eventually befriend a noble native chief and his people; and how a cowboy colonel was willing to risk a previously untried rescue mission to get them out.A riveting work of narrative nonfiction that vividly brings to life an odyssey at times terrifying; enlightening; and comic; Lost in Shangri-La is a thrill ride from beginning to end.",English,USA,384,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524514103l/9729504.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Mitchell Zuckoff,Nonfiction|History|War|World War II|War|Adventure
9780688172180,Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind,"What would you say about a woman who; despite stroke-induced paralysis crippling the entire left side of her body; insists that she is whole and strong--who even sees her left hand reach out to grasp objects? Freud called it ""denial""; neurologists call it ""anosognosia."" However it may be labeled; this phenomenon and others like it allow us peeks into other mental worlds and afford us considerable insight into our own.  The writings of Oliver Sacks and others have shown us that we can learn much about ourselves by looking closely at the deficits shown by people with neurological problems. V.S. Ramachandran has seen countless patients suffering from anosognosia; phantom limb pain; blindsight; and other disorders; and he brings a remarkable mixture of clinical intuition and research savvy to bear on their problems. He is one of the few scientists who are able and willing to explore the personal; subjective ramifications of his work; he rehumanizes an often too-sterile field and captures the spirit of wonder so essential for true discovery. Phantoms in the Brain is equal parts medical mystery; scientific adventure; and philosophical speculation; Ramachandran's writing is smart; caring; and very; very funny. Whether you're curious about the workings of the brain; interested in alternatives to expensive; high-tech science (much of Ramachandran's research is done with materials found around the home); or simply want a fresh perspective on the nature of human consciousness; you'll find satisfaction with Phantoms in the Brain. --Rob Lightner",English,UK,352,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1409601908l/31555.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,V.S.

But it is as mayor of his hometown -- Natchez; Mississippi -- that Penn will face his most dangerous threat.

So begins his quest to find the men responsible. But it's a hunt he begins alone; for the local authorities have been corrupted by the money and power of his hidden enemy. With his family's lives at stake; Penn realizes his only allies in his one-man war are those bound to him by blood or honor: Caitlin Masters; the lover Penn found in The Quiet Can Game and lost in Turning Angel Danny McDavitt; the heroic helicopter pilot from  Tom Cage; Penn's father and legendary local family physician Walt Garrity; a retired Texas Ranger who served with Penn's father during the Korean War.Together they must defeat a sophisticated killer who has an almost preternatural ability to anticipate -- and counter -- their every move.

9780374518170,The Complete Poems 1927-1979,"Elizabeth Bishop was vehement about her art--a perfectionist who didn't want to be seen as a ""woman poet."" In 1977; two years before her death she wrote; ""art is art and to separate writings; paintings; musical compositions; etc.; into two sexes is to emphasize values in them that are not art."" She also deeply distrusted the dominant mode of modern poetry; one practiced with such detached passion by her friend Robert Lowell; the confessional.  Bishop was unforgiving of fashion and limited ways of seeing and feeling; but cast an even more trenchant eye on her own work. One wishes this volume were thicker; though the perfections within mark the rightness of her approach. The poems are sublimely controlled; fraught with word play; fierce moral vision (see her caustic ballad on Ezra Pound; ""Visits to St. Elizabeths""); and reticence. From the surreal sorrow of the early ""Man-Moth"" (leaping off from a typo she had come across for ""mammoth""); about a lonely monster who rarely emerges from ""the pale subways of cement he calls his home;"" to the beauty of her villanelle ""One Art"" (with its repeated ""the art of losing isn't hard to master""); the poet wittily explores distance and desolation; separation and sorrow.",English,UK,287,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436422208l/420278.jpg,Hachette,2002-01-02,Elizabeth Bishop,Poetry|Classics|Literature|American|Literature

9780812932290,Losing My Virginity: How I've Survived; Had Fun; and Made a Fortune Doing Business My Way,"""Oh; screw it; let's do it.""That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard Branson; in slightly more than twenty-five years; to spawn so many successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways); to music (Virgin Records and V2); to cola (Virgin Cola); to retail (Virgin Megastores); and nearly a hundred others; ranging from financial services to bridal wear; Branson has a track record second to none.Losing My Virginity is the unusual; frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business; he and his friends decided that ""since we're complete virgins at business; let's call it just that: Virgin."" Since then; Branson has written his own ""rules"" for success; creating a group of companies with a global presence; but no central headquarters; no management hierarchy; and minimal bureaucracy.Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines; retailing; and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said; ""Don't do it."" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved; where confusion reigns; and the competition is complacent. And in this stressed-out; overworked age; Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic; hardworking; successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family; friends; fun; and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive; sane; balanced life; filled with rich and colorful stories: Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert; yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globeSigning the Sex Pistols; Janet Jackson; the Rolling Stones; Boy George; and Phil CollinsFighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishmentSwimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of MexicoSelling Virgin Records to save Virgin AtlanticStaging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .And much more.

9780316154380,The Ice Queen,"A solitary New Jersey librarian whose favorite book is a guide to suicide methods is struck by lightning in Alice Hoffman's superb novel; The Ice Queen. Orphaned at the age of eight after angrily wishing she would never see her mother again; our heroine found herself frozen emotionally: ""I was the child who stomped her feet and made a single wish and in so doing ended the whole worldÂ‹my world; at any rate."" Her brother Ned solved the pain of their mother's death by becoming a meteorologist: applying reason and logic to bad weather. Eventually; he invites our heroine to move down to Florida; where he teaches at a university. Here; while trying to swat a fly; she is struck by lightning (the resulting neurological damage includes an inability to see the color red). Orlon County turns out to receive two thirds of all the lightning strikes in Florida each year; and our heroine soon becomes drawn into the mysteries of lightning: the withering of trees and landscape near a strike; the medical traumas and odd new abilities of victims; the myths of renewal. Although a recluse; she becomes fascinated by a legendary local farmer nicknamed Lazarus Jones; said to have beaten death after a lightning strike: to have seen the other side and come back. The burning match to her cool reserve--her personal unguided tour through Hades--Lazarus will prove to be the talisman that restores her to girlhood innocence and possibility. Hoffman's story advances with a feline economy of language and movement--not a word spared for the color of the sky; unless the color of the sky factors into the narrative. Among the authors who have played with the fairy tale's harsh mercies (e.g. Margaret Atwood; Angela Carter); Hoffman has the closest understanding of the primal fears that drive the genre; and why; perhaps; we never outgrow fairy stories; but only learn to substitute dull; wholesome qualities like personal initiative or good timing for the elements that raise the hairs on our neck and send us scrambling for the light switch. --Regina Marler",English,USA,211,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1484470829l/595415.jpg,Penguin,2002-01-02,Alice Hoffman,Fiction|Magical Realism|Fantasy|Romance

9780061176100,The Power of Art,"""Great art has dreadful manners;"" Simon Schama observes wryly at the start of his epic and explosive exploration of the power; and whole point; of art. ""The hushed reverence of the gallery can fool you into believing masterpieces are polite things; visions that soothe; charm and beguile; but actually they are thugs. Merciless and wily; the greatest paintings grab you in a headlock; rough up your composure; and then proceed in short order to re-arrange your sense of reality. . . .""With the same disarming force; The Power of Art propels us on an eye-opening; breathtaking odyssey; zooming in on eight extraordinary masterpieces; from Caravaggio's David and Goliath to Picasso's Guernica. Jolting us far from the comfort zone of the hushed art gallery; Schama closes in on intense make-or-break turning points in the lives of eight great artists who; under extreme stress; created something unprecedented; altering the course of art forever.The embattled heroesâ€”Caravaggio; Bernini; Rembrandt; David; Turner; Van Gogh; Picasso and Rothkoâ€”each in his own resolute way; faced crisis with steadfast defiance; pitting passion and conviction against scorn and short-sightedness. The masterpieces they created challenged convention; shattered complacency; shifted awareness and changed the way we look at the world.With vivid storytelling and powerfully evocative descriptive passages; Schama explores the dynamic personalities of the artists and the spirit of the times they lived through; capturing the flamboyant theatre of bourgeois life in Amsterdam; the passion and paranoia of Revolutionary Paris; and the carnage and pathos of Civil War Spain.Most compelling of all; The Power of Art traces the extraordinary evolution of eight ""eye-popping"" world-class works of art. Created in a bolt of illumination; such works ""tell us something about how the world is; how it is to be inside our skins; that no more prosaic source of wisdom can deliver. And when they do that; they answer; irrefutably and majestically; the nagging question of every reluctant art-conscript . . .

9780811826850,The Beatles Anthology,This extraordinary project has been made possible because Paul McCartney; George Harrison and Ringo Starr have agreed to tell their combined story especially for this book. Together with Yoko Ono Lennon; they have also made available the full transcripts (including all the outtakes) of the television and video series The Beatles Anthology. Through painstaking compilation of sources worldwide; John Lennon's words are equally represented in this remarkable volume. Furthermore; The Beatles have opened their personal and management archives specifically for this project; allowing the unprecedented release of photographs which they took along their ride to fame; as well as fascinating documents and memorabilia from their homes and offices. What a book The Beatles Anthology is! Each page is brimming with personal stories and rare vintage images. Snapshots from their family collections take us back to the days when John Lennon; Paul McCartney; George Harrison and Richard Starkey were just boys growing up in Liverpool. They talk in turn about those early years and how they came to join the band that would make them known around the world as John; Paul; George and Ringo. Then; weaving back and forth; they tell the astonishing story of life as The Beatles: the first rough gigs; the phenomenon of their rise to fame; the musical and social change of their heyday; all the way through to their breakup. From the time Ringo tried to take this drum kit home on the bus to their much anticipated audience with Elvis; from the making of the Sgt. Pepper album to their last photo session together at John's house; The Beatles Anthology is a once-in-a-lifetime collection of The Beatles' own memories.Interwoven with these are the recollections of such associates as road manager Neil Aspinall; producer George Martin and spokesman Derek Taylor.

He sees the ""rise of the rest""â€”the growth of countries like China; India; Brazil; Russia; and many othersâ€”as the great story of our time; and one that will reshape the world. The tallest buildings; biggest dams; largest-selling movies; and most advanced cell phones are all being built outside the United States.

9783822858650,M.C. Escher: The Graphic Work,Presenting the structurally unthinkable as though it were a law of nature M.C. Escher was born in 1898 in Leeuwarden (Netherlands). He received his first drawing lessons during secondary school from F.W. van der Haagen; who also taught him the block printing; thus fostering Escher's innate graphic talents. From 1912 to 1922 he studied at the School of Architecture and Ornamental Design in Haarlem; where he was instructed in graphic techniques by S. Jessurun de Mesquita; who greatly influenced Escher's further artistic development. Between 1922 and 1934 the artist lived and worked in Italy. Afterwards Escher spent two years in Switzerland and five in Brussels before finally moving back to Barn in Holland; where he died in 1972. M.C. Escher is not a surrealist drawing us into his dream world; but an architect of perfectly impossible worlds who presents the structurally unthinkable as though it were a law of nature. The resulting dimensional and perspectival illusions bring us into confrontation with the limitations of our sensory perception.

9780375507490,Van Gogh: The Life,Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith galvanized readers with their astonishing Jackson Pollock: An American Saga; winner of the Pulitzer Prize for biography; a book acclaimed for its miraculous research and overwhelming narrative power. Now Naifeh and Smith have written another tour de forceâ€”an exquisitely detailed; compellingly readable; and ultimately heartbreaking portrait of creative genius Vincent van Gogh.Working with the full cooperation of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam; Naifeh and Smith have accessed a wealth of previously untapped materials. While drawing liberally from the artistâ€™s famously eloquent letters; they have also delved into hundreds of unpublished family correspondences; illuminating with poignancy the wanderings of Van Goghâ€™s troubled; restless soul. Naifeh and Smith bring a crucial understanding to the larger-than-life mythology of this great artistâ€”his early struggles to find his place in the world; his intense relationship with his brother Theo; his impetus for turning to brush and canvas; and his move to Provence; where in a brief burst of incandescent productivity he painted some of the best-loved works in Western art.The authors also shed new light on many unexplored aspects of Van Goghâ€™s inner world: his deep immersion in literature and art; his erratic and tumultuous romantic life; and his bouts of depression and mental illness.Though countless books have been written about Van Gogh; and though the broad outlines of his tragedy have long inhabited popular culture; no serious; ambitious examination of his life has been attempted in more than seventy years. Naifeh and Smith have re-created Van Goghâ€™s life with an astounding vividness and psychological acuity that bring a completely new and sympathetic understanding to this unique artistic genius whose signature images of sunflowers and starry nights have won a permanent place in the human imagination.868 pages of text; 953 pages with notes,English,USA,950,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411005913l/10677213.jpg,Harper Collins,1970-02-01,Steven Naifeh|Gregory White Smith,Biography|Nonfiction|Art|Art History|Art|Biography Memoir

9781594487290,How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia,"From the internationally bestselling author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist; the boldly imagined tale of a poor boy's quest for wealth and love. His first two novels established Mohsin Hamid as a radically inventive storyteller with his finger on the world's pulse. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia meets that reputation; and exceeds it. the astonishing and riveting tale of a man's journey from impoverished rural boy to corporate tycoon; it steals its shape from the business self-help books devoured by ambitious youths all over ""rising Asia."" It follows its nameless hero to the sprawling metropolis where he begins to amass an empire built on that most fluid; and increasingly scarce; of goods: water. Yet his heart remains set on something else; on the pretty girl whose star rises along with his; their paths crossing and recrossing; a lifelong affair sparked and snuffed and sparked again by the forces that careen their fates along. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia is a striking slice of contemporary life at a time of crushing upheaval.

9781594205000,Redeployment,"Redeployment takes readers to the frontlines of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; asking us to understand what happened there; and what happened to the soldiers who returned.Phil Klay's Redeployment takes readers to the frontlines of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; asking us to understand what happened there; and what happened to the soldiers who returned. Interwoven with themes of brutality and faith; guilt and fear; helplessness and survival; the characters in these stories struggle to make meaning out of chaos. In ""Redeployment""; a soldier who has had to shoot dogs because they were eating human corpses must learn what it is like to return to domestic life in suburbia; surrounded by people ""who have no idea where Fallujah is; where three members of your platoon died."" In ""After Action Report""; a Lance Corporal seeks expiation for a killing he didn't commit; in order that his best friend will be unburdened. A Morturary Affairs Marine tells about his experiences collecting remains - of U.S. and Iraqi soldiers both. A chaplain sees his understanding of Christianity; and his ability to provide solace through religion; tested by the actions of a ferocious Colonel. And in the darkly comic ""Money as a Weapons System""; a young Foreign Service Officer is given the absurd task of helping Iraqis improve their lives by teaching them to play baseball. These stories reveal the intricate combination of monotony; bureaucracy; comradeship and violence that make up a soldier's daily life at war; and the isolation; remorse; and despair that can accompany a soldier's homecoming. Redeployment is poised to become a classic in the tradition of war writing. Across nations and continents; Klay sets in devastating relief the two worlds a soldier inhabits: one of extremes and one of loss. Written with a hard-eyed realism and stunning emotional depth; this work marks Phil Klay as one of the most talented new voices of his generation.",English,USA,288,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1417987993l/18114068.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Phil Klay,Short Stories|Fiction|War|War|Military Fiction

9780385522270,Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman,The bestselling author of Into the Wild; Into Thin Air; and Under the Banner of Heaven delivers a stunning; eloquent account of a remarkable young manâ€™s haunting journey.Like the men whose epic stories Jon Krakauer has told in his previous bestsellers; Pat Tillman was an irrepressible individualist and iconoclast. In May 2002; Tillman walked away from his $3.6 million NFL contract to enlist in the United States Army. He was deeply troubled by 9/11; and he felt a strong moral obligation to join the fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Two years later; he died on a desolate hillside in southeastern Afghanistan.Though obvious to most of the two dozen soldiers on the scene that a ranger in Tillmanâ€™s own platoon had fired the fatal shots; the Army aggressively maneuvered to keep this information from Tillmanâ€™s wife; other family members; and the American public for five weeks following his death. During this time; President Bush repeatedly invoked Tillmanâ€™s name to promote his administrationâ€™s foreign policy. Long after Tillmanâ€™s nationally televised memorial service; the Army grudgingly notified his closest relatives that he had â€œprobablyâ€been killed by friendly fire while it continued to dissemble about the details of his death and who was responsible.In Where Men Win Glory; Jon Krakauer draws on Tillmanâ€™s journals and letters; interviews with his wife and friends; conversations with the soldiers who served alongside him; and extensive research on the ground in Afghanistan to render an intricate mosaic of this driven; complex; and uncommonly compelling figure as well as the definitive account of the events and actions that led to his death. Before he enlisted in the army; Tillman was familiar to sports aficionados as an undersized; overachieving Arizona Cardinals safety whose virtuosity in the defensive backfield was spellbinding. With his shoulder-length hair; outspoken views; and boundless intellectual curiosity; Tillman was considered a maverick. America was fascinated when he traded the bright lights and riches of the NFL for boot camp and a buzz cut. Sent first to Iraqâ€”a war he would openly declare was â€œillegal as hellâ€â€”and eventually to Afghanistan; Tillman was driven by complicated; emotionally charged; sometimes contradictory notions of duty; honor; justice; patriotism; and masculine pride; and he was determined to serve his entire three-year commitment. But on April 22; 2004; his life would end in a barrage of bullets fired by his fellow soldiers.Krakauer chronicles Tillmanâ€™s riveting; tragic odyssey in engrossing detail highlighting his remarkable character and personality while closely examining the murky; heartbreaking circumstances of his death. Infused with the power and authenticity readers have come to expect from Krakauerâ€™s storytelling; Where Men Win Glory exposes shattering truths about men and war.From the inside cover of ISBN 0385522266 / 9780385522267,English,USA,383,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1439088374l/2936415.jpg,Harper Collins,2002-01-02,Jon Krakauer,Nonfiction|Biography|History|War|War|Military Fiction|Politics

Not a master mason or carpenter; Filippo Brunelleschi was a goldsmith and clock maker. Over twenty-eight years; he would dedicate himself to solving puzzles of the dome's construction. In the process; he did nothing less than reinvent the field of architecture. He engineered the perfect placement of brick and stone (some among the most renowned machines of the Renaissance) to carry an estimated seventy million pounds hundreds of feet into the air; and designed the workers' platforms and routines so carefully that only one man died during the decades of construction.

9781594204110,The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail - But Some Don't,Nate Silver built an innovative system for predicting baseball performance; predicted the 2008 election within a hairâ€™s breadth; and became a national sensation as a bloggerâ€”all by the time he was thirty. The New York Times now publishes FiveThirtyEight.com; where Silver is one of the nationâ€™s most influential political forecasters.Drawing on his own groundbreaking work; Silver examines the world of prediction; investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail; often at great cost to society; because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves; our predictions can get better too. This is the â€œprediction paradoxâ€ The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions; the more successful we can be in planning for the future.In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data; Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas; from hurricanes to baseball; from the poker table to the stock market; from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they goodâ€”or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes; it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases; prediction is still a very rudimentaryâ€”and dangerousâ€”science.Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability; and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable; and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability; they can distinguish the signal from the noise.With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions; Nate Silverâ€™s insights are an essential read.,English,USA,544,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355058876l/13588394.jpg,Crossley,2002-01-02,Nate Silver,Nonfiction|Science|Business|Economics|Politics|Psychology

9781400063250,American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms; divided a nation; and changed Washington foreverAndrew Jackson; his intimate circle of friends; and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated; venerated and reviled; Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power; bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson's election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people; not distant elites; were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years; and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless; changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson's presidency; acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers; he details the human drama-the family; the women; and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson's private world through years of storm and victory.One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents; Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior; the founder of the Democratic Party; and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence; sex; courage; and tragedy. With his powerful persona; his evident bravery; and his mystical connection to the people; Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action; articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example; and virtue in his vision.Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands; he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was; in short; a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious; brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.,English,USA,361,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320480904l/3147367.jpg,Simon and Schuster,2012-08-09,Jon Meacham,History|Biography|Nonfiction|Politics|Presidents|North American Hi...|American History|Politics

9781400032530,His Excellency: George Washington,National BestsellerTo this landmark biography of our first president; Joseph J. Ellis brings the exacting scholarship; shrewd analysis; and lyric prose that have made him one of the premier historians of the Revolutionary era. Training his lens on a figure who sometimes seems as remote as his effigy on Mount Rushmore; Ellis assesses George Washington as a military and political leader and a man whose â€œstatue-like solidityâ€concealed volcanic energies and emotions.Here is the impetuous young officer whose miraculous survival in combat half-convinced him that he could not be killed. Here is the free-spending landowner whose debts to English merchants instilled him with a prickly resentment of imperial power. We see the general who lost more battles than he won and the reluctant president who tried to float above the partisan feuding of his cabinet. His Excellency is a magnificent work; indispensable to an understanding not only of its subject but also of the nation he brought into being.,English,USA,320,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386925509l/6462.jpg,Macmillan,2002-01-02,Joseph J.

9780393068570,Stitches,One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed; his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot; the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.In Stitches; Small; the award-winning childrenâ€™s illustrator and author; re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out; one by one; we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where Davidâ€”a highly anxious yet supremely talented childâ€”all too often became the unwitting object of his parentsâ€buried frustration and rage.Believing that they were trying to do their best; Davidâ€™s parents did just the reverse. Edward Small; a Detroit physician; who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag; was convinced that he could cure his young sonâ€™s respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation; possibly causing Davidâ€™s cancer. Elizabeth; Davidâ€™s mother; tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding; ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions; especially her own; were hidden.Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling; kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale; Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient; to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteenâ€”with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artistâ€”will resonate as the ultimate survival statemen.,English,USA,329,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327728261l/6407014.jpg,Penguin,1988-01-01,David Small,Sequential Art|Graphic Novels|Autobiography|Memoir|Sequential Art|Comics|Nonfiction|Biography

That 20 percent of our time accounts for 80 percent of the work we accomplish? The 80/20 Principle shows how we can achieve much more with much less effort; time; and resources; simply by identifying and focusing our efforts on the 20 percent that really counts.

Written with bracing wit and intelligence; Rachel Maddow's Drift argues that we've drifted away from America's original ideals and become a nation weirdly at peace with perpetual war; with all the financial and human costs that entails. To understand how we've arrived at such a dangerous place; Maddow takes us from the Vietnam War to today's war in Afghanistan; along the way exploring the disturbing rise of executive authority; the gradual outsourcing of our war-making capabilities to private companies; the plummeting percentage of American families whose children fight our constant wars for us; and even the changing fortunes of G.I. Joe. She offers up a fresh; unsparing appraisal of Reagan's radical presidency. Ultimately; she shows us just how much we stand to lose by allowing the priorities of the national security state to overpower our political discourse. Sensible yet provocative; dead serious yet seriÂ­ously funny; Drift will reinvigorate a ""loud and jangly"" political debate about how; when; and where to apply America's strength and power--and who gets to make those decisions.From the Hardcover edition.",English,USA,288,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1318753897l/12143200.jpg,Random House,1988-01-01,Rachel Maddow,Nonfiction|Politics|History|War|War|Military Fiction

In all the current highly publicized debates about creationism and its descendant ""intelligent design;"" there is an element of the controversy that is rarely mentioned-the ""evidence;"" the empirical truth of evolution by natural selection. Even Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould; while extolling the beauty of evolution and examining case studies; have not focused on the evidence itself. Yet the proof is vast; varied; and magnificent; drawn from many different fields of science. Scientists are observing species splitting into two and are finding more and more fossils capturing change in the past-dinosaurs that have sprouted feathers; fish that have grown limbs. ""Why Evolution Is True"" weaves together the many threads of modern work in genetics; paleontology; geology; molecular biology; and anatomy that demonstrate the ""indelible stamp"" of the processes first proposed by Darwin.

He writes about families coping with deafness; dwarfism; Down's syndrome; autism; schizophrenia; or multiple severe disabilities; with children who are prodigies; who are conceived in rape; who become criminals; who are transgender. While each of these characteristics is potentially isolating; the experience of difference within families is universal; and Solomon documents triumphs of love over prejudice in every chapter.All parenting turns on a crucial question: to what extent should parents accept their children for who they are; and to what extent they should help them become their best selves. Drawing on ten years of research and interviews with more than three hundred families; Solomon mines the eloquence of ordinary people facing extreme challenges.Elegantly reported by a spectacularly original and compassionate thinker; Far from the Tree explores how people who love each other must struggle to accept each otherâ€”a theme in every familyâ€™s life.,English,USA,962,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1363008433l/13547504.jpg,Penguin,2010-05-05,Andrew Solomon,Nonfiction|Psychology|Parenting|Science|Sociology
9780385518510,Clapton: The Autobiography,I found a pattern in my behavior that had been repeating itself for years; decades even. Bad choices were my specialty; and if something honest and decent came along; I would shun it or run the other way.â€With striking intimacy and candor; Eric Clapton tells the story of his eventful and inspiring life in this poignant and honest autobiography. More than a rock star; he is an icon; a living embodiment of the history of rock music. Well known for his reserve in a profession marked by self-promotion; flamboyance; and spin; he now chronicles; for the first time; his remarkable personal and professional journeys. Born illegitimate in 1945 and raised by his grandparents; Eric never knew his father and; until the age of nine; believed his actual mother to be his sister. In his early teens his solace was the guitar; and his incredible talent would make him a cult hero in the clubs of Britain and inspire devoted fans to scrawl â€œClapton is Godâ€on the walls of Londonâ€™s Underground. With the formation of Cream; the world's first supergroup; he became a worldwide superstar; but conflicting personalities tore the band apart within two years. His stints in Blind Faith; in Delaney and Bonnie and Friends; and in Derek and the Dominos were also short-lived but yielded some of the most enduring songs in history; including the classic â€œLayla.â€During the late sixties he played as a guest with Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan; as well as the Beatles; the Rolling Stones; and longtime friend George Harrison. It was while working with the latter that he fell for Georgeâ€™s wife; Pattie Boyd; a seemingly unrequited love that led him to the depths of despair; self-imposed seclusion; and drug addiction. By the early seventies he had overcome his addiction and released the bestselling album 461 Ocean Boulevard; with its massive hit â€œI Shot the Sheriff.â€He followed that with the platinum album Slowhand; which included â€œWonderful Tonight;â€the touching love song to Pattie; whom he finally married at the end of 1979. A short time later; however; Eric had replaced heroin with alcohol as his preferred vice; following a pattern of behavior that not only was detrimental to his music but contributed to the eventual breakup of his marriage. In the eighties he would battle and begin his recovery from alcoholism and become a father. But just as his life was coming together; he was struck by a terrible blow: His beloved four-year-old son; Conor; died in a freak accident. At an earlier time Eric might have coped with this tragedy by fleeing into a world of addiction. But now a much stronger man; he took refuge in music; responding with the achingly beautiful â€œTears in Heaven.â€Clapton is the powerfully written story of a survivor; a man who has achieved the pinnacle of success despite extraordinary demons. It is one of the most compelling memoirs of our time.,English,UK,343,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407042555l/1207904.jpg,Macmillan,2010-05-05,Eric Clapton,Music|Biography|Nonfiction|Biography|Autobiography|Autobiography|Memoir

She knows that her real name is Purity; that she's saddled with $130;000 in student debt; that she's squatting with anarchists in Oakland; and that her relationship with her mother - her only family - is hazardous. But she doesn't have a clue who her father is; why her mother chose to live as a recluse with an invented name; or how she'll ever have a normal life. Enter the Germans. A glancing encounter with a German peace activist leads Pip to an internship in South America with The Sunlight Project; an organization that traffics in all the secrets of the world--including; Pip hopes; the secret of her origins. TSP is the brainchild of Andreas Wolf; a charismatic provocateur who rose to fame in the chaos following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Now on the lam in Bolivia; Andreas is drawn to Pip for reasons she doesn't understand; and the intensity of her response to him upends her conventional ideas of right and wrong. Purity is a grand story of youthful idealism; extreme fidelity; and murder. The author of The Corrections and Freedom has imagined a world of vividly original characters - Californians and East Germans; good parents and bad parents; journalists and leakers - and he follows their intertwining paths through landscapes as contemporary as the omnipresent Internet and as ancient as the war between the sexes.

9780321525660,Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery,Presentation Zen will help presenters see the process in a way that is different; simpler; more visual; more natural; more effective; and ultimately far more meaningful. Presentations are generally poor because their creators have learned bad habits and lack awareness and knowledge about what makes for a great presentation (and what does not). This book aims to help people break out of the rut of making typical PowerPoint presentations. This book provides an equal dose of inspiration and education. The content focuses on helping readers become (1) more aware; (2) more knowledgeable; and (3) more inspired. Presentation Zen is a provocative mix of illumination; education; and guidance. What may seem like common sense regarding presentations is not common practice. Presentation Zen is an approach to presentations that is appropriate for our age; an age in which design thinking; storytelling and so-called right-brain thinking are crucial. Those who are talented communicators and skilled in design and storytelling are increasingly in demand.Balancing the principles of design; the tenets of Zen simplicity; multimedia and cognitive learning theory; along with practical advice from the fie,English,USA,229,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348381669l/1908456.jpg,Crossley,2012-08-09,Garr Reynolds,Business|Design|Nonfiction|Language|Communication

9780385343860,Homer's Odyssey,"Once in nine lives; something extraordinary happens... The last thing Gwen Cooper wanted was another cat. She already had two; not to mention a phenomenally underpaying job and a recently broken heart. Then Gwenâ€™s veterinarian called with a story about a three-week-old eyeless kitten whoâ€™d been abandoned. It was love at first sight.Everyone warned that Homer would always be an ""underachiever;"" never as playful or independent as other cats. But the kitten nobody believed in quickly grew into a three-pound dynamo; a tiny daredevil with a giant heart who eagerly made friends with every human who crossed his path. Homer scaled seven-foot bookcases with ease and leapt five feet into the air to catch flies in mid-buzz. He survived being trapped alone for days after 9/11 in an apartment near the World Trade Center; and even saved Gwenâ€™s life when he chased off an intruder who broke into their home in the middle of the night.But it was Homerâ€™s unswerving loyalty; his infinite capacity for love; and his joy in the face of all obstacles that inspired Gwen daily and transformed her life. And by the time she met the man she would marry; she realized Homer had taught her the most important lesson of all: Love isnâ€™t something you see with your eyes.Homerâ€™s Odyssey is the once-in-a-lifetime story of an extraordinary cat and his human companion. It celebrates the refusal to accept limitsâ€”on love; ability; or hope against overwhelming odds. By turns jubilant and moving; itâ€™s a memoir for anybody whoâ€™s ever fallen completely and helplessly in love with a pet.",English,USA,287,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442887803l/6261477.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1970-02-01,Gwen Cooper,Nonfiction|Animals|Animals|Cats|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography

Now sheâ€™s got two kids; a perfect husband; a picket fence; and a growing sense of dissatisfaction. Ray used to be a talented documentary photographer; but at age forty he finds himself in a dead-end job posing as a paparazzo pandering to celebrity-obsessed rich kids. Jack is a detective who canâ€™t let go of a cold caseâ€”a local husband and father disappeared seventeen years ago; and Jack spends the anniversary every year visiting a house frozen in time; the missing manâ€™s family still waiting; his slippers left by the recliner as if he might show up any moment to step into them.

Even as the terrible consequences of long-ago events crash together in the present and threaten to ruin lives; they will come to the startling realization that they may not want to forget the past at all. And as each confronts the dark side of the American Dreamâ€”the boredom of a nice suburban life; the excitement of temptation; the desperation and hunger that can lurk behind even the prettiest facadesâ€”they will discover the hard truth that the line between one kind of life and another can be as whisper-thin as a heartbeat.

When it returned in 10/1423; the emperor had fallen; leaving China in political & economic chaos. The great ships were left to rot at their moorings. Most records of their journeys were destroyed.

9780307265630,The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos,From the best-selling author of The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos comes his most expansive and accessible book to dateâ€”a book that takes on the grandest question: Is ours the only universe?There was a time when â€œuniverseâ€meant all there is. Everything. Yet; in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many. With crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy; Brian Greene shows how a range of different â€œmultiverseâ€proposals emerges from theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgÃ¤ngers; each reading this sentence in a distant universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes; of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time; or one that might be hovering millimeters away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. Or; perhaps strangest of all; a multiverse made purely of math.Greene; one of our foremost physicists and science writers; takes us on a captivating exploration of these parallel worlds and reveals how much of realityâ€™s true nature may be deeply hidden within them. And; with his unrivaled ability to make the most challenging of material accessible and entertaining; Greene tackles the core question: How can fundamental science progress if great swaths of reality lie beyond our reach?Sparked by Greeneâ€™s trademark wit and precision; The Hidden Reality is at once a far-reaching survey of cutting-edge physics and a remarkable journey to the very edge of realityâ€”a journey grounded firmly in science and limited only by our imagination.,English,UK,384,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320431300l/8167094.jpg,Penguin,2010-05-05,Brian Greene,Science|Nonfiction|Science|Physics|Philosophy|Science|Astronomy

9780142003700,Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling,In 1508; despite strong advice to the contrary; the powerful Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the newly restored Sistine Chapel. With little experience as a painter (though famed for his sculpture David); Michelangelo was reluctant to begin the massive project. Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling recounts the four extraordinary years Michelangelo spent laboring over the vast ceiling while the power politics and personal rivalries that abounded in Rome swirled around him. Battling against ill health; financial difficulties; domestic problems; the pope's impatience; and a bitter rivalry with the brilliant young painter Raphael; Michelangelo created scenes so beautiful that they are considered one of the greatest masterpieces of all time.

9780525456070,Rapunzel,Surely among the most original and gifted of children's book illustrators; Paul O. Zelinsky has once again with unmatched emotional authority; control of space; and narrativecapability brought forth a unique vision for an age-old tale. Few artists at work today can touch the level at which his paintings tell a story and exert their hold.Zelinsky's retelling of Rapunzel reaches back beyond the Grimms to a late-seventeenth-century French tale by Mlle. la Force; who based hers on the Neapolitan tale Petrosinella in a collection popular at the time. The artist understands the story's fundamentals to be about possessiveness; confinement; and separation; rather than about punishment and deprivation. Thus the tower the sorceress gives Rapunzel here is not a desolate; barren structure of denial but one of esoteric beauty on the outside and physical luxury within. And the world the artist creates through the elements in his paintings the palette; control of light; landscape; characters; architecture;interiors; costumes speaks to us not of an ugly witch who cruelly imprisons a beautiful young girl; but of a mother figure who powerfully resists her child's inevitable growth; and of a young woman and man who must struggle in the wilderness for the self-reliance that is the true beginningof their adulthood.As ever; and yet always somehow in newly arresting fashion; Paul O. Zelinsky's work thrillingly shows us the events of the story while guiding us beyond them to the truths that have made it endure.,English,UK,36,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430277005l/815158.jpg,Penguin,2012-08-09,Paul O.

9780812966010,Theodore Rex,"Theodore Roosevelt and his two-term presidency (1901-9) deserve a king-size; seize-the-man biography - and Edmund Morris has provided one. ""TR"" typifies the ""can do"" American; his famous maxim; of course; was ""Speak softly but carry a big stick."" Morris presents eyewitness history through the voices of the makers and shakers. His exhilarating narrative will captivate readers; providing welcome confirmation that this nation can produce presidents who bring leadership to great issues; hold to their purpose; and shape the destinies of nations. President McKinley's assassination brought the 43-year-old TR a challenging presidency; one to which Morris is a clearsighted guide. At home; TR had to persuade Congress to curb competition-stifling corporate trusts; monopolistic transcontinental railroads; and unhygienic food industries that saw consumers as sheep. He also faced labor and racial strife. Abroad; the American presence in Cuba and the Philippines brought criticism; the Russo-Japanese conflict threatened major power shifts in the Far East and Europe; and a politically and financially fraught decision on the Central American canal route - Panama or Nicaragua? - had to be made. TR rose to every challenge. Despite the demands of family and social life; he read; wrote; and traveled extensively. Not least; TR put national parks and conservation of natural resources on the legislative agenda.All TR's notable contemporaries - including historian Henry Adams; naturalists John Burroughs and John Muir; robber barons E. H. Harriman and James J. Hill; poet Oliver Wendell Holmes; financier J. P. Morgan; fellow politician William Howard Taft; civil rights leader Booker T. Washington; and novelist Owen Wister - appear onstage; their clear voices projecting the excitement of the day.Morris is blessed with the imagination and skills to write gripping popular history. He doesn't dilute but illuminates events in presenting an account that immediately sparks interest and captures the mind. Readers will note that American interventionism abroad (today's major issue) was much debated during TR's presidency; when major interventional imperatives challenged the new superpower's tradition of relative restraint in foreign affairs.Theodore Rex is the long-awaited second volume of the TR saga. Morris delivered the first volume;

Her first book is a revelatory treatise on plant lifeâ€”but it is also so much more. Lab Girl is a book about work; love; and the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together. It is told through Jahrenâ€™s stories: about her childhood in rural Minnesota with an uncompromising mother and a father who encouraged hours of play in his classroomâ€™s labs; about how she found a sanctuary in science; and learned to perform lab work done â€œwith both the heart and the handsâ€ and about the inevitable disappointments; but also the triumphs and exhilarating discoveries; of scientific work.Yet at the core of this book is the story of a relationship Jahren forged with a brilliant; wounded man named Bill; who becomes her lab partner and best friend. Their sometimes rogue adventures in science take them from the Midwest across the United States and back again; over the Atlantic to the ever-light skies of the North Pole and to tropical Hawaii; where she and her lab currently make their home.,English,USA,290,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441826687l/25733983.jpg,Hachette,2012-08-09,Hope Jahren,Nonfiction|Science|Autobiography|Memoir|Biography

9780965925080,Shadow Divers,In the tradition of Jon Krakauerâ€™s Into Thin Air comes a true tale of riveting adventure in which two weekend scuba divers risk everything to solve a great historical mystery â€and make history themselves.In the tradition of Jon Krakauerâ€™s Into Thin Air and Sebastian Jungerâ€™s The Perfect Storm comes a true tale of riveting adventure in which two weekend scuba divers risk everything to solve a great historical mysteryâ€“and make history themselves.For John Chatterton and Richie Kohler; deep wreck diving was more than a sport. Testing themselves against treacherous currents; braving depths that induced hallucinatory effects; navigating through wreckage as perilous as a minefield; they pushed themselves to their limits and beyond; brushing against death more than once in the rusting hulks of sunken ships.But in the fall of 1991; not even these courageous divers were prepared for what they found 230 feet below the surface; in the frigid Atlantic waters sixty miles off the coast of New Jersey: a World War II German U-boat; its ruined interior a macabre wasteland of twisted metal; tangled wires; and human bonesâ€“all buried under decades of accumulated sediment.No identifying marks were visible on the submarine or the few artifacts brought to the surface. No historian; expert; or government had a clue as to which U-boat the men had found. In fact; the official records all agreed that there simply could not be a sunken U-boat and crew at that location.Over the next six years; an elite team of divers embarked on a quest to solve the mystery. Some of them would not live to see its end. Chatterton and Kohler; at first bitter rivals; would be drawn into a friendship that deepened to an almost mystical sense of brotherhood with each other and with the drowned U-boat sailorsâ€“former enemies of their country. As the menâ€™s marriages frayed under the pressure of a shared obsession; their dives grew more daring; and each realized that he was hunting more than the identities of a lost U-boat and its nameless crew.Author Robert Kursonâ€™s account of this quest is at once thrilling and emotionally complex; and it is written with a vivid sense of what divers actually experience when they meet the dangers of the oceanâ€™s underworld. The story of Shadow Divers often seems too amazing to be true; but it all happened; two hundred thirty feet down; in the deep blue sea.,English,UK,335,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1166028017l/9530.jpg,Harper Collins,1970-02-01,Robert Kurson,Nonfiction|History|Adventure|Biography

9780486234110,Concerning the Spiritual in Art,"A pioneering work in the movement to free art from its traditional bonds to material reality; this book is one of the most important documents in the history of modern art. Written by the famous nonobjective painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866â€944); it explains Kandinsky's own theory of painting and crystallizes the ideas that were influencing many other modern artists of the period. Along with his own groundbreaking paintings; this book had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art.Kandinsky's ideas are presented in two parts. The first part; called ""About General Aesthetic;"" issues a call for a spiritual revolution in painting that will let artists express their own inner lives in abstract; non-material terms. Just as musicians do not depend upon the material world for their music; so artists should not have to depend upon the material world for their art. In the second part; ""About Painting;"" Kandinsky discusses the psychology of colors; the language of form and color; and the responsibilities of the artist. An Introduction by the translator; Michael T. H. Sadler; offers additional explanation of Kandinsky's art and theories; while a new Preface by Richard Stratton discusses Kandinsky's career as a whole and the impact of the book. Making the book even more valuable are nine woodcuts by Kandinsky himself that appear at the chapter headings.This English translation of Ãœber das Geistige in der Kunst was a significant contribution to the understanding of nonobjectivism in art. It continues to be a stimulating and necessary reading experience for every artist; art student; and art patron concerned with the direction of 20th-century painting.",English,USA,80,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405982387l/857502.jpg,Crossley,2002-01-02,Wassily Kandinsky,Art|Nonfiction|Philosophy|Art|Art History

It is an integral part of their marriage; child rearing; and community. In this daring new book; distinguished philosopher Daniel C. Dennett takes a hard look at this phenomenon and asks why. Where does our devotion to God come from and what purpose does it serve? Is religion a blind evolutionary compulsion or a rational choice? In ""Breaking the Spell;"" Dennett argues that the time has come to shed the light of science on the fundamental questions of faith. In a spirited narrative that ranges widely through history; philosophy; and psychology; Dennett explores how organized religion evolved from folk beliefs and why it is such a potent force today. Deftly and lucidly; he contends that the ""belief in belief"" has fogged any attempt to rationally consider the existence of God and the relationship between divinity and human need.""Breaking the Spell"" is not an antireligious screed but rather an eyeopening exploration of the role that belief plays in our lives; our interactions; and our country. With the gulf between rationalists and adherents of ""intelligent design"" widening daily; Dennett has written a timely and provocative book that will be read and passionately debated by believers and nonbelievers alike.",English,USA,448,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406403613l/2067.jpg,Simon and Schuster,1988-01-01,Daniel C.

It was inevitable that I should write about it and the people who lived on both sides of its ""Invisible Wall."" The narrow street where Harry Bernstein grew up; in a small English mill town; was seemingly unremarkable.

His father earns little money at the Jewish tailoring shop and brings home even less; preferring to spend his wages drinking and gambling.

But in a hopeful turn; acclaimed surgeon and writer Atul Gawande finds a remedy in the humblest and simplest of techniques: the checklist.First introduced decades ago by the U.S. Air Force; checklists have enabled pilots to fly aircraft of mind-boggling sophistication. Now innovative checklists are being adopted in hospitals around the world; helping doctors and nurses respond to everything from flu epidemics to avalanches. Even in the immensely complex world of surgery; a simple ninety-second variant has cut the rate of fatalities by more than a third.In riveting stories; Gawande takes us from Austria; where an emergency checklist saved a drowning victim who had spent half an hour underwater; to Michigan; where a cleanliness checklist in intensive care units virtually eliminated a type of deadly hospital infection. He explains how checklists actually work to prompt striking and immediate improvements. And he follows the checklist revolution into fields well beyond medicine; from homeland security to investment banking; skyscraper construction; and businesses of all kinds.An intellectual adventure in which lives are lost and saved and one simple idea makes a tremendous difference; The Checklist Manifesto is essential reading for anyone working to get things right. ,English,UK,225,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1448611979l/7796228.jpg,Hachette,2010-05-05,Atul Gawande,Nonfiction|Health|Medicine|Business|Self Help|Business|Management

9780316042800,Lunch in Paris: A Love Story; with Recipes,In Paris for a weekend visit; Elizabeth Bard sat down to lunch with a handsome Frenchman--and never went home again. Was it love at first sight? Or was it the way her knife slid effortlessly through her pave au poivre; the steak's pink juices puddling into the buttery pepper sauce? Lunch In Paris is a memoir about a young American woman caught up in two passionate love affairs--one with her new beau; Gwendal; the other with French cuisine. Packing her bags for a new life in the world's most romantic city; Elizabeth is plunged into a world of bustling open-air markets; hipster bistros; and size 2 femmes fatales. She learns to gut her first fish (with a little help from Jane Austen); soothe pangs of homesickness (with the rise of a chocolate souffle) and develops a crush on her local butcher (who bears a striking resemblance to Matt Dillon). Elizabeth finds that the deeper she immerses herself in the world of French cuisine; the more Paris itself begins to translate. French culture; she discovers; is not unlike a well-ripened cheese-there may be a crusty exterior; until you cut through to the melting; piquant heart. Peppered with mouth-watering recipes for summer ratatouille; swordfish tartare and molten chocolate cakes; Lunch in Paris is a story of falling in love; redefining success and discovering what it truly means to be at home.
